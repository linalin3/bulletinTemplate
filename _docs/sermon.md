### Prayer
Gracious God, your word is alive and active, sharper than any double-edged sword. Today, when we hear your voice, deliver us from hardness of heart. Help us to put away everything that keeps us from persevering in your way, for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ.  **Amen**. 


### John 17:13-19 (NIRV)

¹³ “I am coming to you now. But I say these things while I am still in the world. I say them so that those you gave me can have the same joy that I have. ¹⁴ I have given them your word. The world has hated them. That’s because they are not part of the world any more than I am. ¹⁵ I do not pray that you will take them out of the world. I pray that you will keep them safe from the evil one. ¹⁶ They do not belong to the world, just as I do not belong to it. ¹⁷ Use the truth to make them holy. Your word is truth. ¹⁸ You sent me into the world. In the same way, I have sent them into the world. ¹⁹ I make myself holy for them so that they too can be made holy by the truth.
