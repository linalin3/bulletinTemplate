- **Move to 124 Forest Rd** We’re extremely grateful for the smooth transition to 124 Forest Road. Thankful for God’s provision and ongoing leading. Thankful for the many people’s involvement to make it happen. Thankful for the sacrifice of the 930 English congregation. It has made a great difference to the kids and leaders in NewGen and opened up opportunities for Gospel.
