- **Respect for Property:** The property, facilities and equipment have been entrusted to us by God for /his mission. During the week, we discovered that a vacuum cleaner in the Hall's cry room is missing, and the TV in that room has been vandalised. We wish to remind all users of the church facilities:  
1. To use the facilities according to church policies, ie to only use them if you have the right to use them. 
2. Ensure that children are properly supervised, and for adults to set a godly example for the children. 
3. To leave the facilities and grounds better than you've found them.
4. Otherwise please treat the church property and facilities with respect.
