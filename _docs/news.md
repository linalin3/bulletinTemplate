## General
- **More to Life:** Please speak to Rev. Lam (alan.lam@stgeorgeshurstville.org.au) for more information. 
- **Water Harvesting System:** There are over 500 students in Nyamusi Primary School Tanzania. Most are poor, can't afford food and lack nutrition. 

  In partnership with the Anglican Diocese of Rorya Tanzania and ARDFA, we are seeking to transform the lives of people living in poverty and demonstrate God's love. We are seeking to raise $7500 (out of a total of $15000 which will be supplemented from our mission budget) over the Easter period (7-23 April) to build a water harvesting system so that children have safe drinking water, the school can grow crops and they can be more self sufficient.
