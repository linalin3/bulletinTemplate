## General
- **Important news about Mandarin ministry**: After prayerful consideration and due process, we are thankful to be able to announce that pastor Elvin Hong has accepted the call to become the pastor of the Mandarin ministry. Pastor Hong will also be leading our leadership and ministry development of the church. He will commence on 18 July 2023. Pastor's Hong's church, Australian Asian Church, will be joining him to be part of the St George's family. This is a wonderful provision of God that we believe will create greater capacity for many opportunities Gospel ministry in the St George's area. Opportunity may well require change and sacrifice.
