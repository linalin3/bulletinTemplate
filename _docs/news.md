2. The parents and the minister agree upon the age and suitability of the child seeking admission to the Lord’s Supper. 
3. The parents and the child receive instruction about the Lord’s Supper, as approved by the minister. 
4. The parents and the child are informed that this practice is not a replacement of Confirmation, and that the child should be confirmed at the appropriate age.
