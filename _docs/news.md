## General
- **More to Life:** Please speak to Rev. Lam (alan.lam@stgeorgeshurstville.org.au) for more information. 
- **Water Harvesting System:** There are over 500 students in Nyamusi Primary School Tanzania. Most are poor, can't afford food and lack nutrition. 

  In partnership with the Anglican Diocese of Rorya Tanzania and ARDFA, we are seeking to transform the lives of people living in poverty and demonstrate God's love. We are seeking to raise $7500 (out of a total of $15000 which will be supplemented from our mission budget) over the Easter period (7-23 April) to build a water harvesting system so that children have safe drinking water, the school can grow crops and they can be more self sufficient. 

  Please place and direct your donations to the mission account (BSB 032055 AN 494673). If you would like a tax deductible receipt, please email: mission@stgeorgeshurstville.org.au


## What’s Next?
- **New?** We’d love to meet you and introduce you to our church. Please speak to one of the pastors for a time to chat. 
- **Growing Together:** The best way to do this is to be part of a small group (Discipleship Group). More information [here]( https://stgeorgeshurstville.org.au/discipleship-groups). 
- **Online Resources:** We are curating some resources on our [website](https://stgeorgeshurstville.org.au/lets-talk-about-christianity).
