## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lordâ€™s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.
- **Collect:** Lord God, you know us to be set in the midst of so many great dangers that by reason of the frailty of our nature we cannot always stand upright: grant us such strength and protection as may support us in all dangers and carry us through all temptations; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
- **Church Sermon** Dear Heavenly Father, thank you for your kindness towards us in offering your Son, Our Lord Jesus Christ, as the sacrifice for our sin granting us the gift of eternal rest in your presence. Thank you for the work of the Holy Spirit causing us to know our fearful need for forgiveness and the joy of full assurance as we rejoice in your grace. Enable us to live for you as we await our arrival in your courts as the Bride of Christ. Amen.

Enable Anglicare to meet human need through loving service and to build communities of resilience, hope and justice. Encourage us to work in mutual partnership to effect positive change. Empower the people we serve to reach their full potential, especially those who experience disadvantage and injustice. Guide us in our advocacy for social justice and strengthen our determination to respond with compassion. Remind us to care for ourselves and each other as we face the challenges of our work, and as we seek reconciliation, healing and community transformation. May you use Anglicare to see Jesus Christ honoured, lives enriched and communities strengthened. All this we pray in the name of Jesus Christ, our servant leader and friend. Amen.
