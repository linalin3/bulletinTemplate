## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.
- **Collect:** Lord, mercifully receive the prayers of your people who call upon you; and grant that we may perceive and know what things we ought to do, and also may have grace and power faithfully to perform them; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
- **Church Sermon:** Father God. You made us in your image. You told us to have serve and have dominion over creation. But we have sinned and allowed the serpent to tempt us. We now live in a world that is difficult, tiring and restless. Thank you for not leaving us. Thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ to defeat Satan and bring in real rest. May we find our rest in Jesus. Amen.

## Mission Prayer Points

- **Berkeley Life Centre** (with Mandarin Discipleship Groups focusing on this mission partner in January). Heavenly Father, you are patient, not wanting anyone to perish but all to find eternal life. You have placed people in certain times and places so that they may find you. We ask that you’ll sustain and use our mission partners to make and mature disciples of all nations. May we be active, involved, enthusiastic, generous and prayerful members. We know that Jesus is gentle and lowly and invites all to cast our burdens upon him. We pray that the people in Berkeley where many are from a low socioeconomic background will cast their burdens on Jesus and find their true treasure in him. Please sustain Rev. Wayne Pickford and his team as they lead the church to be a light and witness in their community.  
- **Compassion** (with Church including children and youth focusing on this mission partner in January).  
- **Aywan and High School Scripture** (with Cantonese Discipleship Groups focusing on this mission partner in January). 
- **JC in SE Asia** (with English Discipleship Groups focusing on this mission partner in January). 


## Regular Prayer Points

- **Connecting Pillar:**  Please help us to be one in love so that the world will know that you sent Jesus and that you love us. Please help us to love one another with a sincere love, not just with words but by what we do.
- **Government:**  Most merciful God, ruler of all the nations, we pray for all those in authority in our nation - the prime minister, premiere, the mayor, the parliaments of our state and the Commonwealth, judges, police - direct and prosper all their work to the advancement of your glory, and the safety and welfare of all the people in this country, so that peace and happiness, truth and justice may be established among us and Christians may live quiet and godly lives as they hold out the word of truth.
- **Children:** Praise God for all the children at St George’s. Please grow in their hearts a love and desire for Jesus and God’s Word. Give strength to parents to disciple their children by modelling Christ-likeness in all of life. We pray for the NewGen leaders to genuinely love the kids.
- **Youth:** Our Father, you’ve called us out of darkness into your marvellous light. May our youths and families find their strength, security and satisfaction in Christ and be a light in a world of darkness and hopelessness. May Jesus be their ultimate treasure especially in a changing and challenging world with many competing priorities and temptations. May you help them to be firm in their faith and courageous in their witness even during the holiday season. May we together be transformed by Christ and represent Jesus.
- **SRE:** Gracious Father, thank you for the unique and wonderful privilege to be invited to teach about Jesus in our local public school. May we never take this for granted. Pray that God will raise up more workers for the harvest field and give rest to the combined team during this holidays so they maybe refreshed to keep teaching and witnessing faithfully in the new year. 
- **Nursing Homes and Seniors Ministries:** We thank you Father, that our hope in Jesus cannot be taken from us. We remember those who are living in residential care, those who are living at home and receiving care, those who are providing the care, and their families. We pray for safety and comfort for the aged. We pray for protection for the carers, workers and volunteers from COVID and other dangers. We pray that all will hear and experience the love and peace of Christ. 
- **Mandarin Congregation:**  Pray that we may represent Jesus well in our family, in church, or in the workplace. Pray that we may not give up meeting together but encourage one another. Pray that many members will join Discipleship groups and their lives be nurtured and shaped by God's word. Thank you Lord for bringing many newcomers to us. Pray that we will welcome newcomers with the love of Jesus and share the gospel with them.
