## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.
- **Collect**: O God, the king of glory, you have exalted your only Son Jesus Christ with great triumph to your kingdom in heaven: leave us not desolate, but send your Holy Spirit to strengthen us, and exalt us to where our Saviour Christ has gone before, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for evermore. Amen.
- **Growing Deep**: Oh Lord, how we love your law! Your word is a lamp to our feet and a light for our path. Thank you that Jesus has give us the Word of Eternal Life. Thank you that heaven and earth may pass away but our Lord’s words will never pass away. Please help us not to conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of our minds by your Word. Please help us to deepen our understanding of and obedience to your Word. 
- **Church Sermon**: Gracious Lord and Heavenly Father,  Not to us, O Lord, not to us but to your name be the glory, because of your love and faithfulness. Why do the nations say, “Where is their God?” You are in heaven. You do as you please. But their idols are silver and gold, made by the hands of men. They have mouths, but cannot speak, eyes, but they cannot see; they have ears, but cannot hear, noses, but they cannot smell; they have hands, but cannot feel, feet, but they cannot walk; nor can they utter a sound with their throats. Those who make them will be like them, and so will all who trust in them. Forgive us for trusting in idols instead of you. For us for making idols of the good gifts you’ve given us. Forgive us for our foolish superstition. We praise you for remembering us and for blessing us who fear you - small and great alike. We thank you for bringing us close to yourself through your son. We praise you for your presence with us by your Spirit. You alone are worthy. Please help us to grow in our trust in and obedience to you, our Lord, you are our help and shield. Amen.

## Mission Partners

- **JC in SE Asia**: You call us to make and mature disciples of all nations. We ask that you’ll allow JC to courageously, lovingly and prayerfully share the gospel in a country where evangelism is not allowed and even publicly practising one’s faith is difficult. May you soften the heart of the authorities and the people of this nation so that they’ll hear and accept the peace, purpose and real spiritual prosperity in Jesus. Help JC to prepare and study well to be an English teacher.

## Regular Prayer Points
- **Government**: You are the ruler of all the nations. May you prosper and direct the work of our Government so that you’ll be glorified; people will be safe; and that there’ll be prosperity, peace, happiness, truth, justice, love and compassion. May they enact laws and initiatives so that the orphans, widows and harassed are looked after. May they be good stewards as they plan in a way that looks after the earth and takes into consideration future generations. May they reward good and punish evil. As citizens, may we pay taxes to Caesar and give to God what belongs to him. As Christians, may we submit to their authority as we hold out the word of life and ultimately submit to you. 
- **Children**: Praise God for all the children at St George’s. Please grow in their hearts a love and desire for Jesus and God’s Word. Give strength to parents to disciple their children by modelling Christ-likeness in all of life. We pray for the NewGen leaders to genuinely love the kids. 
- **Youth**: Our Father, you’ve called us out of darkness into your marvellous light. May our youths and families find their strength and security in Christ and be a light in a world of darkness and at times feelings of hopelessness. May Jesus be their ultimate treasure especially in a changing and challenging world with many competing priorities and temptations. May you help them to be firm in their faith and courageous in their witness especially as we look at the topic of knowing the world and loving the world this term. May we be a church family who are joyful and godly witnesses as we aim to be transformed together and represent Jesus. May we be a safe space where we respect people, the program and the property. 
- **SRE**: Gracious Father, thank you for the unique and wonderful privilege to be invited to teach about Jesus at Hurstville public school. May we never take this for granted. Please bless our relationships with the school, especially with Mr Mark Steed (principal) and Mr Dave Renshaw (school liaison for SRE). Give our combined Christian teacher team (Lam, Carol, George, Fiona, Glorya, Andrew, Alice and Tracey) strength to keep teaching and witnessing faithfully. 
- **Mandarin Congregation**: Pray that we may represent Jesus well in our family, in church, or in the workplace. Pray that we may not give up meeting together but encourage one another.  Pray that many members will join Discipleship groups and their lives be nurtured and shaped by God's word. Thank you Lord for bringing many newcomers to us. Pray that we will welcome newcomers with the love of Jesus and share the gospel with them.
