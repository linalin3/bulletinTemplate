## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.
- **Collect:** Almighty and everlasting God, mercifully look on our infirmities; and in all our dangers and necessities stretch out your right hand to help and defend us; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
- **Church Sermon** Our Father, you made us for rest. We are sorry for when we change its definition and do what we want. May we not make leisure, holidays or travel our idols. Help us to rest by knowing and following you. May we show mercy, grace and love. May we be godly and do good. Amen.

## Mission Prayer Points

- **Papua New Guinea and Mathys:** Father God, we realise that all flesh is like grass yet your word remains forever. We ask that you will use the Mathys and other bible translators to transform PNG for Jesus with your precious and powerful word. Pray that Petra, Andi and Jakob will keep growing in Christ and being missional. May their time in Australia and with different churches be uplifting for both them and the churches. Thank for you helping Calvin to feel better and allowing them to go back to Ukarumpa later this year in July. 
- **Aywan and High School Scripture:** (with Cantonese Discipleship Groups focusing on this mission partner in January). Loving Father, we thank you that you want all people to come to a saving knowledge of you. We ask that the high schoolers in our area (especially at Hurstville Boys, Sydney Tech and Oatley High) will see Jesus as the way, the truth and the life. We pray that Aywan Suleiman will passionately and faithfully teach and model the gospel of love to the people around him.  
- **Berkeley Life Centre:** (with Mandarin Discipleship Groups focusing on this mission partner in January).

## Regular Prayer Points

- **Serving Pillar:** In view of your mercy we offer ourselves as a living sacrifice. Please help us to use the gifts you have given us to serve one another as members of the one body.
- **Hurstville:** We pray that the 30,000 people in Hurstville, with many from different cultures and countries, will come to know Jesus as their Lord and Saviour. May we have a heart for the people you have placed around us. May we be lights in our neighbourhood which is in darkness and filled with anxiety and uncertainty. May we be mindful of the changing demographics and seek to share the gospel with them. May Chris Minns (Legislative Assembly Member for Kogarah), Linda Burney (Lower House Representative for Barton) and David Coleman (Lower House Representative for Banks) and Nick Katris (Mayor) know God as the ultimate authority and serve with love, justice and wisdom. 
- **Discipleship Groups:** Pray that the seed of God’s word will be planted and watered this term. May we have clear direction, wisdom and discipline as we rebuild our discipleship ministry and represent Jesus. 
- **Pastoral Care Team:** Father, you sent your Son to heal the brokenhearted. May we cast our burdens and anxieties upon you knowing that you can sympathise with our weaknesses and care for us. May the peace of God sustain us as we bear the hope of the gospel, point people to heaven and carry each other’s burdens. 
- **Support Ministries**: Everlasting God, we give thanks for the many volunteers who have been faithfully serving in different ministries at church especially in this challenging period of time. Please strengthen and sustain them with patience and understanding that they may love and care for your people. Please grant that together they may follow and help others to follow Jesus Christ. May they offer their given gifts and talents to build up the church which is the body of Christ. We ask this for the communication, vestry, cleaning, flower, bulletin, meals, AV, sound, technology and other teams. 
- **New Life Nepalese Church**: We thank you for our Nepalese brothers and sisters who share our building. May they grow in their knowledge of your love for them and continue to speak the truth in love to their community. We pray that through their ministry, many more Nepalese would come to serve the Lord Jesus Christ, as we do. 
- **Singles, Widows and Orphans**: We praise you, God of love and the creator of the universe, for making us male and female, and giving us the gift of each other. We pray for those who, like our Lord Jesus Christ, are unmarried; either by external factors, their own decision and/or devotion to you. Lord, we praise you for the new family you have created, the household of all who believe in your Son. Father, help us to love one another in deep and meaningful friendships that no one may feel alone or without the joy of companionship. Deepen our trust in your provision for all our needs so that we may live in contentment until we all come to your eternal kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
