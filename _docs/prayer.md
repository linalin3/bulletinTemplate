## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.
- **Collect:** Almighty God, whose blessed Son was circumcised and for man’s sake became obedient to the Law: purify our hearts and all our members, so that we may die to all sinful desires and in all things obey your holy will; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
- **Church Sermon:** Almighty Creator and Father, we praise you for creating rest. May we enjoy the fruits of our labour; be physically and mentally restored; and spend meaningful time with others. Above all, may we reflect upon and praise God for his blessing and goodness.

## Mission Prayer Points

- **Compassion** (with Church including children and youth focusing on this mission partner in December). Father, you are like a mother hen who gathers her children under her wings. You allow little children to come to you and told us that unless we become like children we’ll never enter the kingdom of heaven. May you help us to realise our need for you and depend on you in all areas of life. We pray for Compassion which seeks to release children from poverty in Jesus’ name. May we along with them do what we can to love children and families so that they will grow well physically, mentally, socially and most importantly spiritually. 
- **Aywan and High School Scripture** (with Cantonese Discipleship Groups focusing on this mission partner in December). 
- **Berkeley Life Centre** (with Mandarin Discipleship Groups focusing on this mission partner in December). 
- **JC in SE Asia** (with English Discipleship Groups focusing on this mission partner in December). 
- **Persecuted Christians**: Father God, you are our refuge and strength and a very present help in times of trouble. We praise you for our perfect high priest who can empathise with our weaknesses. We praise you for our eternal and certain hope in Christ. For those who are suffering because of Christ, we cry along with them: “Your Kingdom Come”. Please sustain them in faith, forgiveness and joy. May they be a model, witness and encouragement to us and the people around them.

## Regular Prayer Points

- **Saving Pillar:** We pray that the word of truth, the gospel that has come to us will continue to grow and bear fruit in the world. Please help us in our witness of Jesus in Hurstville, in our workplace, among our neighbours and among strangers.
- **World:** Sovereign Lord, you observe all those who dwell on earth. Have mercy we pray on those who now suffer the miseries of a war not of their own making. Have compassion on the wounded and dying; comfort the broken-hearted; confound the hatred and madness of those who make war; guide our rulers, bring war to an end, bring peace across the world. Unite us all under the reign of your Son, the Prince of Peace, before whose judgement seat the rulers of the world will give account, and in whose name we pray.
- **Redevelopment:** Our Gracious God and Heavenly Father, You know our needs. You have richly provided and we know that you will continue to provide what we need for the mission that you have called us to. May our faithful stewardship bear witness to the love of Jesus Christ in our lives. We pray for a new temporary building to cater for our ministry needs especially our children’s ministry. We ask this in the name of the one who is building us into a spiritual house for a holy priesthood and to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to you.
- **Sunday Services:** Thank you heavenly Father for our ascended King. Thank you for the gifts of apostles, evangelists, pastors, teachers, service leaders, musicians and all those who serve us. We pray that you will use their service for the building up of the church, that we may reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of your Son and become mature. We ask this for Bible readers, service leaders, musicians, welcomers and other volunteers. 
- **Staff and Parish Council:** We praise you for the leaders you’ve appointed over us. May they love and care for the church of God which you obtained with your own blood. May they prayerfully set forth the life giving word through their lives and teaching. Clothe them with holiness, zeal and servant heartedness. We pray for our wardens and parish councillors, may they have wisdom, insight and passion to see our church family be spiritually transformed for your glory. Please use them to help us stay focused and accountable with the resources you’ve given us. 
- **English Congregations:** May we have Jesus as the centre of our lives in 2023. May God use our programs and plans to see us deepen our trust, have a personal relationship with God and have a faith that is public. 
- **Families:** We remember the families of our church community. We pray that despite the busyness, you will be an ever presence and comfort to them. Please help kids and their families to set the right priorities, the discipline to say ‘no’. Please be with those who feel stressed and challenged, that you will provide timely help in their needs. We thank God for all those who are part of the English congregations of this church: Wednesday, 930am and 4pm. We pray that as we seek to minister to one another in 2023, that you will mercifully cause us to grow in our knowledge of your love, that we will grow in our love for you, for one another and to our neighbours. May our love for and devotion to you be our greatest desire. We bow our knees before you the Father from whom every family is named. Bless our homes. Help parents and spiritual uncles and aunties to impart the knowledge of you and of your love; and children to respond with love and obedience. May our homes be blessed with peace, truth and joy. We praise you, God of love and the creator of the universe, for making us male and female, and giving us the gift of each other. We pray for those who, like our Lord Jesus Christ, are unmarried; either by external factors, their own decision and/or devotion to you. Lord, we praise you for the new family you have created, the household of all who believe in your Son. Father, help us to love one another in deep and meaningful friendships that no one may feel alone or without the joy of companionship. Deepen our trust in your provision for all our needs so that we may live in contentment until we all come to your eternal kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
