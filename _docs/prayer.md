## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.
- **Collect**: Almighty God, you have conquered death through your dearly beloved Son Jesus Christ and opened to us the gate of everlasting life: grant us by your grace to set our mind on things above, so that by your continual help our whole life may be transformed; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who is alive and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit in everlasting glory. Amen.
- **Church Sermon:** Exalted and resurrected Lord Jesus, with hearts full and hands raised we shout with joy, “The Lord is risen! He is risen indeed!” You didn’t lie or exaggerate. The cross is empty. The tomb is empty. Death is done. Satan crushed. Despair is finished. Condemnation is condemned. Hope is restored. Jesus, because you’ve been raised from the dead, preaching the gospel is not useless. Our faith in you is not futile. We’re confident that we are no longer condemned. Thank you for guaranteeing the “new creation”. The frustration of this creation and the decay of our bodies and minds will give way to a new creation and new bodies. Thank you that our tears will be wiped away and our sorrows remembered no more. Jesus, because you’ve been raised from the dead, we can ‘see’ the kingdom of God and the defeat of all evil, injustice and suffering. You are risen! You are risen indeed. Hallelujah! Amen.  
- **Church Mission:** _At that time men will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory. And he will send his angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens_ (Mark 13:26-27). Our Gracious Father, thank you for the privilege of calling us to join in your mission. Thank you that under you what we do makes a difference in the world. We pray therefore that you will save those around us and to transform them into the likeness of Jesus. Please use us to make disciples of the nations, love our neighbours. Please Father, glorify yourself, through our labour in your Son. We pray that we will not be consumers but contributors to the ministries that you have called us to. 
- **Growing Up:** Heavenly Father, we trust your love, grace and acceptance, and that you created and saved us to live for your glory. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the saviour of the world, and your gospel as your power for salvation for all who believe. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the holy, loving, powerful and generous saviour, head, lord, and judge of St George’s. We trust you as the just judge of all people, and that you will bring glory to yourself through our church and in Christ Jesus. Forgive us in living for trivial happiness and false securities rather than holiness. We pray that we will die to sin every day and live for righteousness; that we will deny ourselves, take up our cross and follow Jesus every day. 

 

## Weekly Prayer Points

May they understand your love and mercy and how the Cross allows you to be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus. May we keep being mindful of our neighbours and love them.

## Regular Prayer Points

- **Australia:** Guide with your wisdom and power the leaders of the nation, so that everyone may live in peace and mutual trust, sharing with justice the resources of the earth. Give the people of this land a spirit of unselfishness, compassion, and fairness in public and private life. May you bring an end to the pandemic so that we might be able to live quiet and peaceful lives in order that people may come to a knowledge of the truth. We pray that you would give our leaders wisdom and a fear of you. We pray that many in our nation who are suffering may find hope, peace, comfort, life and purpose in the gospel of your Son. May Anthony Albanese and Chris Minns lead Australia and NSW well in a time of change and anxiety. Indigenous. 
- **Berkeley Life Centre:** Heavenly Father, you are patient, not wanting anyone to perish but all to find eternal life. You have placed people in certain times and places so that they may find you. We ask that you’ll sustain and use our mission partners to make and mature disciples of all nations. May we be active, involved, enthusiastic, generous and prayerful members. We know that Jesus is gentle and lowly and invites all to cast our burdens upon him. We pray that the people in Berkeley where many are from a low socioeconomic background will cast their burdens on Jesus and find their true treasure in him. Please sustain Rev. Wayne Pickford and his team as they lead the church to be a light and witness in their community.  
- **Empowering Everyone with English in Jesus’ Name:** We praise you for the many people groups that are in Hurstville. May we have a heart for them to settle and live well in Australia and more importantly to find their true residence in the New Heaven. May the teachers and volunteers be a model of love and good works as they teach people about Jesus and English. 
- **CanCare:** Father God, we thank you that you know what it means to face trials and pain and that you can sympathise with our weaknesses. We ask that you’ll use CanCare to support people and their family and friends who are or have suffered the ravages of cancer. Please give them wisdom in how to support this community especially during this uncertain period of COVID. May God bless those suffering from cancer with his peace. May God's salvation come to those who have yet to accept Jesus.
- **Evangelism Teams and Programs:** Gracious Lord, our neighbours are lost and far away from you. We long for the opportunity to proclaim your name. Please give us the eyes to see those whom you have placed before us. Whenever I open my mouth, may words be given to me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel. We pray that as the seeds of the gospel are scattered and planted, that they would land on good soil. Please make them bear fruit, Father. Scare away the crows. Crush the rocks. Strangle the weeds. Instead, give us rich healthy soil ready to receive the seeds of the gospel. In Jesus’ name, we pray. 
- **Nursing Homes and Seniors Ministries:** We thank you Father, that our hope in Jesus cannot be taken from us. We remember those who are living in residential care, those who are living at home and receiving care, those who are providing the care, and their families. We pray for safety and comfort for the aged. We pray for protection for the carers, workers and volunteers from COVID and other dangers. We pray that all will hear and experience the love and peace of Christ. 
- **Cantonese Congregations:** Lord, we pray for Janette Zhu who was baptized on Apr 8 that her faith continues to grow, to witness Jesus at home and in her workplace. We pray for the families recently joining us that the children enjoy the kids’ program and their parents find supporting fellowship in church. Pray for the D-group leaders and members that they have a good rest during the Easter holiday break. Some people go overseas. Pray that they have a safe trip. Amen.
