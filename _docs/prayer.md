## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.
- **Collect:** Lord Jesus Christ, for our sake you fasted forty days and forty nights: give us grace to use such abstinence that, our flesh being subdued to the spirit, we may always obey your will in righteousness and true holiness, to your honour and glory; for you live and reign with the Father and the Holy Spirit, one God, for evermore. Amen.
- **Church Sermon:** Help us to know who Jesus is. Help us to see that he is the promised king. Help us to understand that he is the one who is righteous and humble; refine God’s people and bring forgiveness to all nations. Sorry for when we fail to recognise who Jesus is and as a result bring on judgement upon ourselves and hinder others from seeing Christ. Please help us to live for Jesus every day before everyone in every situation. Amen.  



## Weekly Prayer Points

- **Earthquake in Turkey and Syria**.
  - From ARDFA: Pray for God's comfort and peace on suffering Christians who are injured, traumatised or grieving and reeling from the devastation. Pray for our partners and other Christians reaching out in compassion to their communities, that God will sustain them and give them wisdom to manage their response to the crisis. Pray for God's mercy to prevent further devastation and death and for those involved in the rescue missions. Pray that churches and Christians will provide a powerful witness to God's love to suffering communities, just like they did in the 1999 Turkey earthquake.
  - From the Dean of Sydney and Anglican Aid: Almighty and gracious God, we offer our prayers to you for the nations of Türkiye and Syria, shaken by violent earthquake and aftershocks. We are reminded of our vulnerability as human creatures who inhabit this vast earth. As the ancient psalmist wrote, “You are our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in times of trouble.” Please uphold those under whom the earth has just given way. Calm their fears and enable many to turn to you for help in their distress. We pray for those in Türkiye and Syria who grieve the devastating loss of life; for the injured or traumatised; for those searching for survivors; for those whose property has been destroyed or livelihoods ruined. We ask for your healing presence in their lives. We ask you to speed access and to strengthen all those involved in search and rescue, and in care for the injured. We commend to your care those who will work in the clean up. May shelter from the elements, with clean water, food and medical care be supplied as quickly as possible. Be with the governments of these nations, and support efforts sent from other countries around the world, along with aid agencies, churches and other organisations, as they seek to serve. Sustain them through a time of tremendous stress. We pray for Turkish and Syrian migrants among us in Australia who feel homesick and far away from loved ones at this time. May generous gestures of practical aid and prayer support offered lift the spirits of those who hurt. Please help Anglican Aid’s long-term partner Damascus Church Aid as it provides food hampers to those in desperate need. We thank you for their enduring, loving witness to a people that has suffered in war and economic crisis. Please give Rev Samir Yacco and other Damascus Church Aid staff grace and wisdom to allocate resources wisely to help the most needy, bringing glory to the Lord Jesus as they share his love. We give thanks to you, our God, for the blessing in our lives, especially for the gifts we so often take for granted till they are in danger of being taken from us - the gift of family, friends, a home, our possessions. Help us to be generous with what we have for the sake of those in need. Most of all we praise you for the gift of Jesus Christ, who is the resurrection and the life to all who believe in him. And we look for the day when you will wipe every tear away from our eyes, through Jesus Christ, our rock and our redeemer. Amen. 

- **Pride Month**.
  - From Dominic Steele in Eternity News. We pray for Australia, for those who are confused or in pain in regards to their identity or sexuality, or are struggling to listen to you, follow you or obey you in the area of sexuality. We ask for your mercy and for a special gift of your Spirit. Forgive us Lord for when we have not lived as you would have us lived. Forgive us for the things we have done with our bodies that we should not have done. Forgive us for the things we have looked at that really we wish we hadn’t seen. Forgive us for the things for we have thought and said that were wrong. Forgive us for when we run away from you, like the younger son in the Prodigal Parable. Forgive us also for when we have been far from your heart, proud and judgemental, like the older brother in the Prodigal Parable. Thank you for the Lord Jesus Christ. Thank you that he always lived to please you in every area of life. Thank you that he perfectly offered himself on the cross to pay for our wrong before you. Thank you that his death was enough to pay for all our wrong. Thank you that you raised the Lord Jesus Christ from the dead as our ruler and judge. Help us now to live to please you in our thoughts and in our actions. Please Lord give us your spirit that we might live lives of celibacy in singleness and faithfulness in marriage. Please help married men to be faithful to their wives. Please help married women to be faithful to their husbands. Keep us from unfaithfulness in our thoughts, in our actions, and in what we look at. Lord again where we have failed you please forgive us. Help us to each help those who are caught up in a wrongdoing. Help us to restore each other in a gentle spirit, watching out that we won’t be tempted. Lord keep us from the sin of acting wrongly. And keep us from pride. We pray that Australia’s churches might be ‘hospitals for sinners,’ where we can safely come broken to you, where we can find people who will love us in our sin, and speak to us of the Lord Jesus, reminding us of his forgiveness, and pointing us to his Holiness. And Lord, we pray especially for those who are tempted to mock you or insult you. We ask for your mercy Lord, that you in your kindness you would extend forgiveness and love. And we pray these things in the powerful name of Jesus. Amen.

## Mission Prayer Points

- **Papua New Guinea and Mathys:** Father God, we realise that all flesh is like grass yet your word remains forever. We ask that you will use the Mathys and other bible translators to transform PNG for Jesus with your precious and powerful word. Pray that Petra, Andi and Jakob will keep growing in Christ and being missional. 
- **JC in SE Asia** (with English Discipleship Groups focusing on this mission partner in Feb): You call us to make and mature disciples of all nations. We ask that you’ll allow JC to courageously, lovingly and prayerfully share the gospel in a country where evangelism is not allowed and even publicly practicing one’s faith is difficult. May you soften the heart of the authorities and the people of this nation so that they’ll hear and accept the peace, purpose and real spiritual prosperity in Jesus. 
- **Berkeley Life Centre** (with Mandarin Discipleship Groups focusing on this mission partner in Feb). 
- **Compassion** (with Church including children and youth focusing on this mission partner in Feb).
- **Aywan and High School Scripture** (with Cantonese Discipleship Groups focusing on this mission partner in Feb). Loving Father, we thank you that you want all people to come to a saving knowledge of you. We ask that the high schoolers in our area (especially at Hurstville Boys, Sydney Tech and Oatley High) will see Jesus as the way, the truth and the life. We pray that Aywan Suleiman will passionately and faithfully teach and model the gospel of love to the people around him.  

## Regular Prayer Points

- **Serving Pillar:** Please help us to be one in love so that the world will know that you sent Jesus and that you love us. Please help us to love one another with a sincere love, not just with words but by what we do. 
- **Hurstville:** We pray that the 30,000 people in Hurstville, with many from different cultures and countries, will come to know Jesus as their Lord and Saviour. May we have a heart for the people you have placed around us. May we be lights in our neighbourhood which is in darkness and filled with anxiety and uncertainty. May we be mindful of the changing demographics and seek to share the gospel with them. May Chris Minns (Legislative Assembly Member for Kogarah), Linda Burney (Lower House Representative for Barton), David Coleman (Lower House Representative for Banks) and Nick Katris (Mayor) know God as the ultimate authority and serve with love, justice and wisdom. 
- **Discipleship Groups:** Pray that the seed of God’s word will be planted and watered this term. May we have clear direction, wisdom and discipline as we rebuild our discipleship ministry and represent Jesus. 
- **Pastoral Care Team:** Father, you sent your Son to heal the brokenhearted. May we cast our burdens and anxieties upon you knowing that you can sympathise with our weaknesses and care for us. May the peace of God sustain us as we bear the hope of the gospel, point people to heaven and carry each other’s burdens. 
- **Support Ministries:** Everlasting God, we give thanks for the many volunteers who have been faithfully serving in different ministries at church especially in this challenging period of time. Please strengthen and sustain them with patience and understanding that they may love and care for your people. Please grant that together they may follow and help others to follow Jesus Christ. May they offer their given gifts and talents to build up the church which is the body of Christ. We ask this for the communication, vestry, cleaning, flower, bulletin, meals, AV, sound, technology and other teams. 
- **New Life Nepalese Church:** We thank you for our Nepalese brothers and sisters who share our building. May they grow in their knowledge of your love for them and continue to speak the truth in love to their community. We pray that through their ministry, many more Nepalese would come to serve the Lord Jesus Christ, as we do. 
- **Singles, Widows and Orphans:** We praise you, God of love and the creator of the universe, for making us male and female, and giving us the gift of each other. We pray for those who, like our Lord Jesus Christ, are unmarried; either by external factors, their own decision and/or devotion to you. Lord, we praise you for the new family you have created, the household of all who believe in your Son. Father, help us to love one another in deep and meaningful friendships that no one may feel alone or without the joy of companionship. Deepen our trust in your provision for all our needs so that we may live in contentment until we all come to your eternal kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
