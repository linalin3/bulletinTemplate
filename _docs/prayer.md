## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.
- **Collect:** Heavenly Father, keep your household the Church continually in your true religion; that those who lean only on the hope of your heavenly grace may always be defended by your mighty power; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. 
- **Church Sermon**  Gracious Lord and loving Father, Thank you that you are a giving God. Thank you for giving your son to save us from our sins. Thank you that Jesus gave his life to bring us back to you. Thank you for giving  us your Spirit and your Word that we may be transformed to be like you. We are sorry that we hold back, doubting your wisdom and goodness. We have been foolishly seeking to gain the world rather than following Jesus. Today we recommit ourselves to follow Jesus. Please help us to unconditionally surrender all our lives to your loving care and control.  Help us to be givers rather than takers. Please direct us and use us to bring glory to you. Amen.

## Regular Prayer Points

- **Saving Pillar:** We pray that the word of truth, the gospel that has come to us will continue to grow and bear fruit in the world. Please help us in our witness of Jesus in Hurstville, in our workplace, among our neighbours and among strangers.
- **World:** We pray that you will lead the nations of the world in the ways of righteousness and peace. Please guide our rulers in wisdom and justice. May there be tranquillity so that we can live godly and holy lives and people can come to the knowledge of the truth. May we submit to those you’ve placed in authority and ultimately to your reign and rule. May people live and long for the new world to come rather than seek to gain the world and forfeit our souls. 
- **Persecuted Christians:** We thank you for sending Jesus who is sovereign and came to save the world by sacrificing himself. Please give patience and perseverance to those who are being persecuted for the faith. May they be an model and example of what it means to have a calling in life and a confidence for the future. May they seek to do the will of you rather than themselves. May there be justice. If this isn’t achieved, may they keep looking to you as the judge and respond with love rather than revenge. You can sign up for more prayer points and updates of persecuted Christians from Open Doors (https://vom.com.au/pray-for-the-persecuted-church/) and Voice of the Martyrs (https://vom.com.au/prayer/). 
- **Redevelopment:** Our Gracious God and Heavenly Father, You know our needs. You have richly provided and we know that you will continue to provide what we need for the mission that you have called us to. May our faithful stewardship bear witness to the love of Jesus Christ in our lives. We pray this in the name of the one who is building us into a spiritual house for a holy priesthood and to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to you.
- **Sunday Services:** Thank you heavenly Father for our ascended King. Thank you for the gifts of apostles, evangelists, pastors, teachers, service leaders, musicians and all those who serve us. We pray that you will use their service for the building up of the church, that we may reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of your Son and become mature. We ask this for Bible readers, service leaders, musicians, welcomers and other volunteers. 
- **Staff and Parish Council:** We praise you for the leaders you’ve appointed over us. May they love and care for the church of God which you obtained with your own blood. May they prayerfully set forth the life giving word through their lives and teaching. Clothe them with holiness, zeal and servant heartedness. We pray for our wardens and parish councillors, may they have wisdom, insight and passion to see our church family be spiritually transformed for your glory. Please use them to help us stay focused and accountable with the resources you’ve given us. 
- **English Congregations:** May we have Jesus as the centre of our lives in 2023. May God use our programs and plans to see us deepen our trust, have a personal relationship with God and have a faith that is public. 
- **Families:** We remember the families of our church community. We pray that despite the busyness, you will be an ever presence and comfort to them. Please help kids and their families to set the right priorities, the discipline to say ‘no’. Please be with those who feel stressed and challenged, that you will provide timely help in their needs. We thank God for all those who are part of the English congregations of this church - Wednesday, 930am and 4pm. We pray that as we seek to minister to one another in 2022, that you will mercifully cause us to grow in our knowledge of your love, that we will grow in our love for you, for one another and to our neighbours. May our love for and devotion to you be our greatest desire. We bow our knees before you the Father from whom every family is named. Bless our homes. Help parents and spiritual uncles and aunties to impart the knowledge of you and of your love; and children to respond with love and obedience. May our homes be blessed with peace, truth and joy. We praise you, God of love and the creator of the universe, for making us male and female, and giving us the gift of each other. We pray for those who, like our Lord Jesus Christ, are unmarried; either by external factors, their own decision and/or devotion to you. Lord, we praise you for the new family you have created, the household of all who believe in your Son. Father, help us to love one another in deep and meaningful friendships that no one may feel alone or without the joy of companionship. Deepen our trust in your provision for all our needs so that we may live in contentment until we all come to your eternal kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
