## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.
- **Collect:** Almighty and everlasting God, mercifully look on our infirmities; and in all our dangers and necessities stretch out your right hand to help and defend us; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
- **Church Sermon** Heavenly Father, thank you for your wonderful grace shown to us in the salvation rest granted to us by the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. As those who are truly your children enable us by your indwelling Holy Spirit to live lives worthy of the Gospel loving both you and our neighbours in obedience to your will. To your glory, amen.

## Mission Prayer Points

- **Papua New Guinea and Mathys:** Father God, we realise that all flesh is like grass yet your word remains forever. We ask that you will use the Mathys and other bible translators to transform PNG for Jesus with your precious and powerful word. Pray that Petra, Andi and Jakob will keep growing in Christ and being missional. May their time in Australia and with different churches be uplifting for both them and the churches. Thank for you helping Calvin to feel better and allowing them to go back to Ukarumpa later this year in July. 
- **Aywan and High School Scripture:** (with Cantonese Discipleship Groups focusing on this mission partner in January). Loving Father, we thank you that you want all people to come to a saving knowledge of you. We ask that the high schoolers in our area (especially at Hurstville Boys, Sydney Tech and Oatley High) will see Jesus as the way, the truth and the life. We pray that Aywan Suleiman will passionately and faithfully teach and model the gospel of love to the people around him.  
- **Berkeley Life Centre:** (with Mandarin Discipleship Groups focusing on this mission partner in January).
- **Compassion:** (with Church including children and youth focusing on this mission partner in January).

## Regular Prayer Points

- **Serving Pillar:** In view of your mercy we offer ourselves as a living sacrifice. Please help us to use the gifts you have given us to serve one another as members of the one body.
- **Hurstville:** We pray that the 30,000 people in Hurstville, with many from different cultures and countries, will come to know Jesus as their Lord and Saviour. May we have a heart for the people you have placed around us. May we be lights in our neighbourhood which is in darkness and filled with anxiety and uncertainty. May we be mindful of the changing demographics and seek to share the gospel with them. May Chris Minns (Legislative Assembly Member for Kogarah), Linda Burney (Lower House Representative for Barton) and David Coleman (Lower House Representative for Banks) and Nick Katris (Mayor) know God as the ultimate authority and serve with love, justice and wisdom. 
- **Discipleship Groups:** Pray that the seed of God’s word will be planted and watered this term. May we have clear direction, wisdom and discipline as we rebuild our discipleship ministry and represent Jesus. 
- **Pastoral Care Team:** Father, you sent your Son to heal the brokenhearted. May we cast our burdens and anxieties upon you knowing that you can sympathise with our weaknesses and care for us. May the peace of God sustain us as we bear the hope of the gospel, point people to heaven and carry each other’s burdens.
