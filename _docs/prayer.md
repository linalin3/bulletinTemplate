## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.
- **Collect:** Almighty God, we pray that the course of this world may be so peaceably ordered through your guidance that your church may joyfully serve you in all godly quietness; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
- **Church Sermon:** Heavenly Father, Jesus tells us that unless his words live in us we cannot serve him as we should. Forgive us when we have been slack in not reading our Bibles to feed on his words. Help us to spend time and effort in reading, understanding and living out the scriptures so that we bring glory to you and peace in our hearts. In the name of Jesus, Amen.

## Mission Partners
- **Berkley Life Centre:** Heavenly Father, you are patient, not wanting anyone to perish but all to find eternal life. You have placed people in certain times and places so that they may find you. We know that Jesus is gentle and lowly and invites all to cast their burdens upon him. We pray that the people in Berkeley where many are from a low socioeconomic background will cast their burdens on Jesus and find their true treasure in him. We praise you for providing Samantha Trotter who will help with the womens and children ministry later in the year.

## Regular Prayer Points
- **Australia:** Guide with your wisdom and power the leaders of the nation, so that everyone may live in peace and mutual trust, sharing with justice the resources of the earth. Give the people of this land a spirit of unselfishness, compassion, and fairness in public and private life. May you bring an end to the pandemic so that we might be able to live quiet and peaceful lives in order that people may come to a knowledge of the truth. We pray that you would give our leaders wisdom and a fear of you. We pray that many in our nation who are suffering may find hope, peace, comfort, life and purpose in the gospel of your Son. May Anthony Albanese and Chris Minns lead Australia and NSW well in a time of change and anxiety. Indigenous.  
- **Evangelism Teams and Programs:** Gracious Lord, our neighbours are lost and far away from you. We long for the opportunity to proclaim your name. Please give us the eyes to see those whom you have placed before us. Whenever I open my mouth, may words be given to me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel. We pray that as the seeds of the gospel are scattered and planted, that they would land on good soil. Please make them bear fruit, Father. Scare away the crows. Crush the rocks. Strangle the weeds. Instead, give us rich healthy soil ready to receive the seeds of the gospel. In Jesus’ name, we pray. 
- **Nursing Homes and Seniors Minsitries** We thank you Father, that our hope in Jesus cannot be taken from us. We remember those who are living in residential care, those who are living at home and receiving care, those who are providing the care, and their families. We pray for safety and comfort for the aged. We pray for protection for the carers, workers and volunteers from COVID and other dangers. We pray that all will hear and experience the love and peace of Christ. 
- **Cantonese Congregations:** Lord, we pray for our people as they read the Bible with your Spirit’s guidance. That you open their eyes to see their own weakness, your power and wisdom come upon them. We pray that the d-group leaders are blessed with your grace and they desire to share your words. We pray that through your words, we can overcome the hardship of lives, whether on health, finance, relationship, etc. We pray that we grow not by doing ministry but by knowing Jesus deeper, by living a life that pleases God. Lord, help us to live a godly life and we support each in our church community. In Jesus’ name we pray, Amen.
