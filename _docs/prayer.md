## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.
- **Collect**: Almighty God, you have given your only Son to be for us both a sacrifice for sin and also an example of godly life; give us grace that we may always thankfully receive the immeasurable benefit of his sacrifice, and also daily endeavour to follow in the blessed steps of his most holy life; who now lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for evermore. Amen.
- **Church Mission “Make Disciples,Love neighbours, Glorify God”:** Our gracious Father, thank you for the privilege of calling us to join in your mission. Thank you that under you what we do makes a difference in the world. We pray therefore that you will save those around us and to transform them into the likeness of Jesus. Please use us to make disciples of the nations, love our neighbours. Please Father, glorify yourself, through our labour in your Son. We pray that we will not be consumers but contributors to the ministries that you have called us to. 

- **Church Sermon:** “Our gracious Lord and heavenly Father, 
Our heart rejoices in you; you have given strength to our Jesus Christ and exalted him by his Resurrection, 
in Him you have given us victory over sin, the world and the Enemy. 
We lift our voices to you before your enemies, for we delight in your salvation. 
There is no one holy like the Lord; there is no one besides you; there is no Rock like our God. 
Forgive us when we speak proudly or with arrogance, forgive us when we forget that  
you know and will judge our deeds. 
We praise you that you are the God of the strong and weak, the rich and the poor, 
That you will humble the great ones in the world, and bless the poor and the meek. 
You are the one who closes wombs and opens them. 
You give and you take. You bring death and make alive. 
For the foundations of the earth are yours; upon them you have set the world. 
You will guard the feet of his saints, but the wicked will be silenced in darkness. 
Help us not to boast in strength and power, but in you and the Gospel of your son, your power for salvation for all those who believe. 


 

## Weekly Prayer Points

- **New School Commencing**
- **Ministries Re-Commencing** 
- **Those struggling with infertility and in difficult marriages and family situations:** 
We pray for those who long to be moms, long to have children, and yet are not able to do so.
Father of mercies, give us comfort in our sadness, trust in you despite unfulfilled longings,
and joy in knowing that you never stop loving us or having our best in mind. We pray these things to you as our Father, who loved us before the world began, and will love us forevermore.
In Jesus’ name, amen!

Lord Jesus, 

We come before your throne of grace today bringing marriages and families with us. We pray for those in difficult family situations and marriages, those who are discouraged, disconnected, despairing, broken. Yet your Word reminds us that your grace is sufficient. Your love for us in Jesus is better than life. Your love is enough to satisfy our deepest longings and thirst. Your Spirit is able to change us and giving us hope for what is to come. 

Jesus free us from our sin so that we can love our spouse and our family in all circumstances.Protect us from the Evil one and rescue us from ourselves. Show us how to care for one another in ways that bring your glory. Bring hope to the hopeless, conviction to the foolish, nourishment to the famished, grace to the betrayed, and repentance to the betrayers. Help us to abide in you, as you abide in us. Amen.
