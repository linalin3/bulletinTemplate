## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.
- **Collect:** God our Father, you have prepared for those who love you such good things as pass man’s understanding: pour into our hearts such love towards you, that we, loving you above all things, may obtain your promises which exceed all that we can desire; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
- **Growing Out:** Our gracious Father, thank you that the Gospel is the power of salvation to all people. We pray that many in our generation will hear and truly understand you grace. Please help us to take our faith in Jesus beyond the walls of the church into our workplace, school, where we live and where we holiday. Please help us to have a compassion for the lost like Jesus. Please help us to be willing to go into the world, to be interested in the lives of people we meet. Please give us opportunities to represent Jesus and to speak of Him. Please give us the words to say. Please save our neighbours through us.
- **Church Sermon:** Heavenly Father, thank you for sending your Son into the world so that we can have life through knowing your Son. Thank you that we are your beloved. Thank you that you love the World and that you long for the World to know your love. We are sorry that we have sometimes avoided the World and at other times joined the join. We are sorry that we have hoarded your love and kept your love for ourselves.  Thank you for placing us where we are with the people there - in our families, school, work or where we live. Help us to love them as you love them. Help us to tell them and show them that they are loved. Help us to do this together with our brothers and sisters.

## Mission Partners
- **JC in SE Asia:** You call us to make and mature disciples of all nations. We ask that you’ll allow JC to courageously, lovingly and prayerfully share the gospel in a country where evangelism is not allowed and even publicly practicing one’s faith is difficult. May you soften the heart of the authorities and the people of this nation so that they’ll hear and accept the peace, purpose and real spiritual prosperity in Jesus.

## Regular Prayer Points
- **Government:** You are the ruler of all the nations. May you prosper and direct the work of our Government so that you’ll be glorified; people will be safe; and that there’ll be prosperity, peace, happiness, truth, justice, love and compassion. May they enact laws and initiatives so that the orphans, widows and harassed are looked after. May they be good stewards as they plan in a way that looks after the earth and takes into consideration future generations. May they reward good and punish evil. As citizens, may we pay taxes to Caesar and give to God what belongs to him. As Christians, may we submit to their authority as we hold out the word of life and ultimately submit to you. 
- **Children:**  Praise God for all the children at St George’s. Please grow in their hearts a love and desire for Jesus and God’s Word. Give strength to parents to disciple their children by modelling Christ-likeness in all of life. We pray for the NewGen leaders to rest well during the school holidays and be refreshed in the new term to genuinely love the kids. 
- **Youth**  Our Father, you’ve called us out of darkness into your marvellous light. May our youths and families find their strength and security in Christ and be a light in a world of darkness and at times feelings of hopelessness. May Jesus be their ultimate treasure especially in a changing and challenging world with many competing priorities and temptations. May you help them to be firm in their faith and courageous in their witness. May we be a church family who are joyful and godly witnesses as we aim to be transformed together and represent Jesus.
- **SRE:** Gracious Father, thank you for the unique and wonderful privilege to be invited to teach about Jesus in our local public school. May we never take this for granted. Give our combined Christian teacher team (Lam, Carol, George, Alice, Tracey, Glorya, Fiona, and Andrew) strength to keep teaching and witnessing faithfully.
- **Mandarin Congregation:** Pray that we may represent Jesus well in our family, in church, or in the workplace. Pray that we may not give up meeting together but encourage one another.  Pray that many members will join Discipleship groups and their lives be nurtured and shaped by God's word. Thank you Lord for bringing many newcomers to us. Pray that we will welcome newcomers with the love of Jesus and share the gospel with them. We pray for Pastor Elvin Hong, that he and his congregation will have a smooth transition to our church.
