## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.
- **Collect:** Heavenly Father, keep your household the Church continually in your true religion; that those who lean only on the hope of your heavenly grace may always be defended by your mighty power; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. 
- **Church Sermon**: Gracious Lord and loving Father, Thank you that you are a giving God. Thank you for giving your son to save us from our sins. Thank you that Jesus gave his life to bring us back to you. Thank you for giving  us your Spirit and your Word that we may be transformed to be like you. We are sorry that we hold back, doubting your wisdom and goodness. We have been foolishly seeking to gain the world rather than following Jesus. Today we recommit ourselves to follow Jesus. Please help us to unconditionally surrender all our lives to your loving care and control.  Help us to be givers rather than takers. Please direct us and use us to bring glory to you. Amen.


## Weekly Prayer Points

- Start of the School Term. 
- Start of church ministries e.g. NewGen, D groups, Youth, English Classes. 
- The Church of England General Synod. 
- Earthquake in Turkey and Syria. 
  - **From ARDFA:** Pray for God's comfort and peace on suffering Christians who are injured, traumatised or grieving and reeling from the devastation. Pray for our partners and other Christians reaching out in compassion to their communities, that God will sustain them and give them wisdom to manage their response to the crisis. Pray for God's mercy to prevent further devastation and death and for those involved in the rescue missions. Pray that churches and Christians will provide a powerful witness to God's love to suffering communities, just like they did in the 1999 Turkey earthquake.
  **- From the Dean of Sydney and Anglican Aid:** Almighty and gracious God, we offer our prayers to you for the nations of Türkiye and Syria, shaken by violent earthquake and aftershocks. We are reminded of our vulnerability as human creatures who inhabit this vast earth. As the ancient psalmist wrote, “You are our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in times of trouble.” Please uphold those under whom the earth has just given way. Calm their fears and enable many to turn to you for help in their distress. We pray for those in Türkiye and Syria who grieve the devastating loss of life; for the injured or traumatised; for those searching for survivors; for those whose property has been destroyed or livelihoods ruined. We ask for your healing presence in their lives. We ask you to speed access and to strengthen all those involved in search and rescue, and in care for the injured. We commend to your care those who will work in the clean up. May shelter from the elements, with clean water, food and medical care be supplied as quickly as possible. Be with the governments of these nations, and support efforts sent from other countries around the world, along with aid agencies, churches and other organisations, as they seek to serve. Sustain them through a time of tremendous stress. We pray for Turkish and Syrian migrants among us in Australia who feel homesick and far away from loved ones at this time. May generous gestures of practical aid and prayer support offered lift the spirits of those who hurt. Please help Anglican Aid’s long-term partner Damascus Church Aid as it provides food hampers to those in desperate need. We thank you for their enduring, loving witness to a people that has suffered in war and economic crisis. Please give Rev Samir Yacco and other Damascus Church Aid staff grace and wisdom to allocate resources wisely to help the most needy, bringing glory to the Lord Jesus as they share his love. We give thanks to you, our God, for the blessing in our lives, especially for the gifts we so often take for granted till they are in danger of being taken from us - the gift of family, friends, a home, our possessions. Help us to be generous with what we have for the sake of those in need. Most of all we praise you for the gift of Jesus Christ, who is the resurrection and the life to all who believe in him. And we look for the day when you will wipe every tear away from our eyes, through Jesus Christ, our rock and our redeemer. Amen.

## Regular Prayer Points

- **Seeking:** Thank you Father that while we were still far off you met us in your Son and brought us home. Please help us to remember to welcome everyone, young and old, strangers and friends, as if we were welcoming you.  
- **Australia:** Guide with your wisdom and power the leaders of the nation, so that everyone may live in peace and mutual trust, sharing with justice the resources of the earth. Give the people of this land a spirit of unselfishness, compassion, and fairness in public and private life. May you bring an end to the pandemic so that we might be able to live quiet and peaceful lives in order that people may come to a knowledge of the truth. We pray that you would give our leaders wisdom and a fear of you. We pray that many in our nation who are suffering may find hope, peace, comfort, life and purpose in the gospel of your Son. May Anthony Albanese and Dominic Perrottet lead Australia and NSW well in a time of change and anxiety. Indigenous. 
- **Empowering Everyone with English in Jesus’ Name:** We praise you for the many people groups that are in Hurstville. May we have a heart for them to settle and live well in Australia and more importantly to find their true residence in the New Heaven. May the teachers and volunteers be a model of love and good works as they teach people about Jesus and English. 
- **CanCare:** Father God, we thank you that you know what it means to face trials and pain and that you can sympathise with our weaknesses. We ask that you’ll use CanCare to support people and their family and friends who are or have suffered the ravages of cancer. Please give them wisdom in how to support this community especially during this uncertain period of COVID. May God bless those suffering from cancer with his peace. May God's salvation come to those who have yet to accept Jesus.
- **Evangelism Teams and Programs:** Gracious Lord, our neighbours are lost and far away from you. We long for the opportunity to proclaim your name. Please give us the eyes to see those whom you have placed before us. Whenever I open my mouth, may words be given to me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel. We pray that as the seeds of the gospel are scattered and planted, that they would land on good soil. Please make them bear fruit, Father. Scare away the crows. Crush the rocks. Strangle the weeds. Instead, give us rich healthy soil ready to receive the seeds of the gospel. In Jesus’ name, we pray. 
- **Nursing Homes and Seniors Ministries:** We thank you Father, that our hope in Jesus cannot be taken from us. We remember those who are living in residential care, those who are living at home and receiving care, those who are providing the care, and their families. We pray for safety and comfort for the aged. We pray for protection for the carers, workers and volunteers from COVID and other dangers. We pray that all will hear and experience the love and peace of Christ. 
- **Cantonese Congregations:** Lord, keep them in your hand with physical and spiritual health. Strengthen them through your Word so that they would see your grace is sufficient. We pray for our leaders who care for the growth of the congregation that everyone would read the bible personally. We pray that people would know our Lord and walk with Him everyday. We pray for the Gospel class that the seekers will know Jesus from the bible and they will gratefully receive Christ. Amen.
