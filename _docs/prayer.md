## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.
- **Collect**: Lord God, the unfailing helper and guide of those whom you bring up in your steadfast fear and love, keep us, we pray, under the protection of your good providence, and give us a continual reverence and love for your holy name; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
- **Growing Deep**: Oh Lord, how We love your law! Your word is a lamp to our feet and a light for our path. Thank you that Jesus has give us the Word of Eternal Life. Thank you that heaven and earth may pass away but our Lord’s words will never pass away. Please help us not to conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of our minds by your Word. Please help us to deepen our understanding of and obedience to your Word. 

- **Church Sermon**: Gracious Lord and Heavenly Father, the world trusts in power and relies on smarts, but you have sent your Son as the crucified Christ You have chosen the foolish things to shame the wise; the weak things to shame the strong; the lowly and despised things to nullify the great things in the world. Thank you for choosing us to represent Jesus in the world. Please help us not to loose heart when we face obstacles, disappointments and rejection. Please help us to set forth the word of truth plainly before all. Please help us to preach Christ and not ourselves, but to be servants to those around us. Please shine the light of the knowledge of your glory into the hearts of those who have been blinded by the god of this age. Amen.

## Mission Partners
- **Local High School Scripture with Aywan**: Loving Father, we thank you that you want all people to come to a saving knowledge of you. We ask that the high schoolers in our area (especially at Hurstville Boys, Sydney Tech and Oatley High) will see Jesus as the way, the truth and the life. May you help students to find their identity and security in Jesus particularly when things get busy, life doesn’t work out as planned and things may seem confusing and meaningless. We pray that Aywan Suleiman will passionately and faithfully teach and model the gospel of love to the students and the people around him. We praise you for allowing a group at Oatley to start up. We ask that you’ll grow the number of students who get to hear about Jesus including the Year 7 group at Hurstville Boys. May all find their wisdom in Jesus. 
- **ARDFA (Anglican Relief Development Fund Australia)**: May we demonstrate the love of Christ and spread the Gospel all over the world by helping the poor and needy through Christians serving in their own communities. We pray for ARDFA to holistically transform the lives of people in Asia, Africa and the Pacific and also in areas where they are providing emergency relief such as Myanmar, Rwanda, Turkey, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Ukraine, Afghanistan and Australia. We praise you for being able to partner with ARDFA to build a water harvesting system in Tanzania where students can have access to clean water, be more self sufficient and further gospel proclamation through church planting. 
- **JC in Asia**: You call us to make and mature disciples of all nations. We ask that you’ll allow JC to courageously, lovingly and prayerfully share the gospel in a country where evangelism is not allowed and even publicly practising one’s faith is difficult. May you soften the hearts of the authorities and the people so that they’ll hear and accept the peace, purpose and real spiritual prosperity in Jesus. May you raise up Christians and leaders in the university and church. 
- **Berkeley Life Centre**: Heavenly Father, you are patient, not wanting anyone to perish but all to find eternal life. You have placed people in certain times and places so that they may find you. We know that Jesus is gentle and lowly and invites all to cast their burdens upon him. We pray that the people in Berkeley where many are from a low socioeconomic background will cast their burdens on Jesus and find their true treasure in him. May people who are suffering from domestic violence, dealing with the police and justice system, suffering from mental illness, experiencing difficult and dysfunctional relationships and navigating health issues will know that Jesus has come for the sinners and to seek and save the lost. Please sustain Rev. Wayne Pickford and the team as they lead the church to be a light and witness in their community. We praise you for providing Samantha Trotter who will help with the womens and children ministry later in the year. 
- **Papua New Guinea and Mathys**: Father God, we realise that all flesh is like grass yet your word remains forever. We ask that you will use the Mathys and other bible translators to transform PNG for Jesus with your precious and powerful word. We pray that Petra, Andi and Jakob will keep growing in Christ and being missional. May the 17 million people in PNG come to know Christ as their Lord and Saviour. Please help the locals to cope with the rising cost of living and uncertainties in the future. 
- **Compassion**: Jesus came to seek and to save the lost. You tell us that true religion is to visit orphans and widows in their affliction. May Compassion Australia seek to release children from poverty in Jesus’ name. May we do what we can to love children and their families so that they will mature physically, mentally, socially and most importantly spiritually. May we prayerfully invest in the lives of the children in Sumba Indonesia and see a whole region won and living for God. May you give wisdom to our 11 partner churches in the area to love and care for the children. May these children have enough sustenance, health and support as they participate in the program and activities. For those who personally sponsor a child, may we keep praying, communicating and supporting them and their family.

## Regular Prayer Points
- **Australia**: Guide with your wisdom and power the leaders of the nation, so that everyone may live in peace and mutual trust, sharing with justice the resources of the earth. Give the people of this land a spirit of unselfishness, compassion and fairness in public and private life. May you bring an end to the pandemic so that we might be able to live quiet and peaceful lives in order that people may come to a knowledge of the truth. We pray that you would give our leaders wisdom and a fear of you. We pray that many in our nation who are suffering may find hope, peace, comfort, life and purpose in the gospel of your Son. May Anthony Albanese and Chris Minns lead Australia and NSW well in a time of change and anxiety. May Christians love our Indigenous population and may they come to know Christ’s love. 
- **Empowering Everyone with English in Jesus’ Name**: We praise you for the many people groups that are in Hurstville. May we have a heart for them to settle and live well in Australia and more importantly to find their true residence in the New Heaven. May the teachers and volunteers be a model of love and good works as they teach people about Jesus and English. Many many students come along to our Investigating Christianity course and find true salvation.  
- **CanCare**: Father God, we thank you that you know what it means to face trials and pain and that you can sympathise with our weaknesses. We thank you that you use CanCare to support people and their family and friends who are or have suffered from the ravages of cancer. May God bless those suffering from cancer with His peace. May God's salvation come to those who have yet to accept Jesus. If you want to know more about CanCare services, please watch the video clip from the following links: [in Cantonese with English subtitle](https://youtu.be/UFue6TYMEQA) or [in Mandarin](https://youtu.be/RrEQJKZvvs0). 
- **Evangelism Teams and Programs**: Gracious Lord, our neighbours are lost and far away from you. We long for the opportunity to proclaim your name. Please give us the eyes to see those whom you have placed before us. Whenever I open my mouth, may words be given to me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel. We pray that as the seeds of the gospel are scattered and planted, that they would land on good soil. Please make them bear fruit, Father. Scare away the crows. Crush the rocks. Strangle the weeds. Instead, give us rich healthy soil ready to receive the seeds of the gospel. May we combine our universes, listen deeply and share a story about Jesus in light of the tips we heard from our Growing Out conference. In Jesus’ name, we pray. 
- **Nursing Homes and Seniors Ministries**: We thank you Father, that our hope in Jesus cannot be taken from us. We remember those who are living in residential care, those who are living at home and receiving care, those who are providing the care, and their families. We pray for safety and comfort for the aged. We pray for protection for the carers, workers and volunteers from COVID and other dangers. We pray that all will hear and experience the love and peace of Christ. 
- **Cantonese Congregations**: Lord, we pray that after the training from Sam Chan, we will seek the ways to reach out to non-believers. Pray that in our d-group, we encourage each other to go out to our friends, family and community. Wisely engage in their activities so that relationship with non-believers can be built. We pray for the plan of training people for personal follow-up ministry. We pray that the worship team can be grown by having more pianists.  We pray for the coming three Wednesdays of Gospel class after English Class on 12:00-12:45pm. That more people are coming, our discussion is relevant to their situation and the Gospel introduce them the savior and best friend Jesus.
