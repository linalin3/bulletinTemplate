## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lordâ€™s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.
- **Collect:** Lord, let your continual pity cleanse and defend your church, and because it cannot continue in safety without your aid, keep it evermore by your help and goodness; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
- **Church Sermon:** Dear God, We are sorry that we live as if we control the future. We are sorry that we hoard and may have hurt other people. Thank you that you control our future. Thank you that you have given enough for us for our own use and to be able to help others. Help us to use the time and money you have given us for your glory and the good of other people. Amen.

## Weekly Prayer Points

- Market Day (24 September): Praise God for our inaugural event, the people involved and the contact we had with the community, the funds raised for Pakistan.
- Flood in Pakistan: In Psalm 46, we read these words of encouragement and comfort: God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Almighty God, Creator and preserver of our world. We ask you to hear our humble prayers for all those affected by the devastating floodwaters throughout Pakistan. Our heart breaks when we see the suffering faced by this nation, with a third of the country being flooded, and so many people affected. In your mercy, bring relief to those who have lost much and face ongoing challenges in the days and months ahead. We pray for the sick, the injured and the homeless. Have compassion on those who grieve the loss of loved ones. In the midst of suffering, comfort men, women and children according to their needs. Give courage and hope in the midst of despair. Through the generosity of governments and individuals, provide a future for those whose present circumstances are marked by loss and desperation. Grant wisdom to those who assist, especially those directly involved in emergency services, the government, churches, and aid agencies. And by your gracious hand, rebuild communities where men, women and children are nurtured with care and love. We particularly pray for Christians, churches, and Christian agencies serving affected communities. By your grace, enable and equip them to be faithful servants in the midst of hardship and effective witnesses of your saving message. At this time, may those without genuine peace find true hope in your Son, Jesus. In His name we pray. AMEN. More information: https://ardfa.org.au/ardfa/posts/floods-in-pakistan

## Mission Prayer Points

- Local High School Scripture: Loving Father, we thank you that you want all people to come to a saving knowledge of you. We ask that the high schoolers in our area (especially at Hurstville Boys, Sydney Tech and Oatley High) will see Jesus as the way, the truth and the life. We pray that Aywan Suleiman will passionately and faithfully teach and model the gospel of love to the people around him. As Aywan and Sophia get married on the 30th of Sep, may God grow them in their marriage as they seek to serve God and others together.
- Compassion (Church, Youth and Children).

## Regular Prayer Points

- Saving Pillar: We pray that the word of truth, the gospel that has come to us will continue to grow and bear fruit in the world. Please help us in our witness of Jesus in Hurstville, in our workplace, among our neighbours and among strangers.
- World: Sovereign Lord, you observe all those who dwell on earth. Have mercy we pray on those who now suffer the miseries of a war not of their own making. Have compassion on the wounded and dying; comfort the broken-hearted; confound the hatred and madness of those who make war; guide our rulers, bring war to an end, bring peace across the world. Unite us all under the reign of your Son, the Prince of Peace, before whose judgement seat the rulers of the world will give account, and in whose name we pray.
