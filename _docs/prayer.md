## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.
- **Collect**: Heavenly Father, the giver of all good things, fill our hearts with thankfulness, and grant that by your holy inspiration we may think those things that are good, and by your merciful guidance may perform them; through our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
- **Growing Up**: Heavenly Father, we trust your love, grace and acceptance, and that you created and saved us to live for your glory. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the saviour of the world, and your gospel as your power for salvation for all who believe. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the holy, loving, powerful and generous saviour, head, lord, and judge of St George’s. We trust you as the just judge of all people, and that you will bring glory to yourself through our church and in Christ Jesus. Forgive us in living for trivial happiness and false securities rather than holiness. We pray that we will die to sin every day and live for righteousness; that we will deny ourselves, take up our cross and follow Jesus every day. 
- **Church Sermon**: Our gracious Lord and heavenly Father, our heart breaks when we see prominent Christians fall. We grieve at those who have suffered and continue to suffer as a result of their actions and our inaction. Often, we, your church, have been complicit and have contributed to evil and suffering. We are ashamed of the failures that dishonour your Name and cause the world to blaspheme against you. Thank you that Jesus is what we could not be. Thank you that Jesus died for our sins and shame. Thank you that Jesus faithfully makes your name known. Thank you that Jesus glorifies you with his obedience. Thank you that Jesus is our great high priest.  Thank you for making us into a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to you, that we  may declare your praises. Please help us to live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse us of doing wrong, they may see our good deeds and glorify you on the day you visit us. Amen. 

 

## Weekly Prayer Points
- **Mother’s/Women’s Day**: Heavenly Father, we thank you for the way you have made us relational creatures, and for the blessing of families. We thank you for the gift of mothers, and for the significant role they play not only in families, but in communities as well. We pray for those who might long to have this role but for whatever reason have not received this opportunity. We also pray for those who are mothers but who are mothers alone as a result of death, separation or divorce. Please comfort all these women in any grief they may experience this Mother's Day. Help them to keep casting their cares onto you. May we find our identity, significance and joy in Jesus. Please guard them from despair and bitterness and instead, please redeem their situations, helping them to use their disposition to nurture those you have placed around them. We thank you for the blessing of being part of your family, and for the significant role all women can play as spiritual mothers within our church families and communities.

## Mission Partners

- **Berkeley Life Centre**: Heavenly Father, you are patient, not wanting anyone to perish but all to find eternal life. You have placed people in certain times and places so that they may find you. We ask that you’ll sustain and use our mission partners to make and mature disciples of all nations. May we be active, involved, enthusiastic, generous and prayerful members. We know that Jesus is gentle and lowly and invites all to cast our burdens upon him. We pray that the people in Berkeley where many are from a low socioeconomic background will cast their burdens on Jesus and find their true treasure in him. Please sustain Rev. Wayne Pickford and his team as they lead the church to be a light and witness in their community.

## Regular Prayer Points

- **Australia**: Guide with your wisdom and power the leaders of the nation, so that everyone may live in peace and mutual trust, sharing with justice the resources of the earth. Give the people of this land a spirit of unselfishness, compassion, and fairness in public and private life. May you bring an end to the pandemic so that we might be able to live quiet and peaceful lives in order that people may come to a knowledge of the truth. We pray that you would give our leaders wisdom and a fear of you. We pray that many in our nation who are suffering may find hope, peace, comfort, life and purpose in the gospel of your Son. May Anthony Albanese and Chris Minns lead Australia and NSW well in a time of change and anxiety. Indigenous. 
- **Empowering Everyone with English in Jesus’ Name**: We praise you for the many people groups that are in Hurstville. May we have a heart for them to settle and live well in Australia and more importantly to find their true residence in the New Heaven. May the teachers and volunteers be a model of love and good works as they teach people about Jesus and English. 
- **CanCare**: Father God, we thank you that you know what it means to face trials and pain and that you can sympathise with our weaknesses. We ask that you’ll use CanCare to support people and their family and friends who are or have suffered the ravages of cancer. Please give them wisdom in how to support this community especially during this uncertain period of COVID. May God bless those suffering from cancer with his peace. May God's salvation come to those who have yet to accept Jesus.
- **Evangelism Teams and Programs**: Gracious Lord, our neighbours are lost and far away from you. We long for the opportunity to proclaim your name. Please give us the eyes to see those whom you have placed before us. Whenever I open my mouth, may words be given to me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel. We pray that as the seeds of the gospel are scattered and planted, that they would land on good soil. Please make them bear fruit, Father. Scare away the crows. Crush the rocks. Strangle the weeds. Instead, give us rich healthy soil ready to receive the seeds of the gospel. In Jesus’ name, we pray. 
- **Nursing Homes and Seniors Ministries**: We thank you Father, that our hope in Jesus cannot be taken from us. We remember those who are living in residential care, those who are living at home and receiving care, those who are providing the care, and their families. We pray for safety and comfort for the aged. We pray for protection for the carers, workers and volunteers from COVID and other dangers. We pray that all will hear and experience the love and peace of Christ. 
- **Cantonese Congregations**: Lord, keep them in your hand with physical and spiritual health. Strengthen them through your Word so that they would see your grace is sufficient. We pray for our leaders who care for the growth of the congregation that everyone would read the bible personally. We pray that people would know our Lord and walk with Him everyday. We pray for the Gospel class starting from May 7 that the seekers will know Jesus from the bible and they will gratefully receive Christ. Amen.
