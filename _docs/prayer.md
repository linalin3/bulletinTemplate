## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.
- **Collect:** Lord, mercifully receive the prayers of your people who call upon you; and grant that we may perceive and know what things we ought to do, and also may have grace and power faithfully to perform them; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
- **Church Sermon:** Father God. You made us in your image. You told us to have serve and have dominion over creation. But we have sinned and allowed the serpent to tempt us. We now live in a world that is difficult, tiring and restless. Thank you for not leaving us. Thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ to defeat Satan and bring in real rest. May we find our rest in Jesus. Amen.

## Mission Prayer Points

- **Berkeley Life Centre** (with Mandarin Discipleship Groups focusing on this mission partner in January). Heavenly Father, you are patient, not wanting anyone to perish but all to find eternal life. You have placed people in certain times and places so that they may find you. We ask that you’ll sustain and use our mission partners to make and mature disciples of all nations. May we be active, involved, enthusiastic, generous and prayerful members. We know that Jesus is gentle and lowly and invites all to cast our burdens upon him. We pray that the people in Berkeley where many are from a low socioeconomic background will cast their burdens on Jesus and find their true treasure in him. Please sustain Rev. Wayne Pickford and his team as they lead the church to be a light and witness in their community.  
- **Compassion** (with Church including children and youth focusing on this mission partner in January).  
- **Aywan and High School Scripture** (with Cantonese Discipleship Groups focusing on this mission partner in January). 
- **JC in SE Asia** (with English Discipleship Groups focusing on this mission partner in January). 


## Regular Prayer Points

- **Seeking:** Thank you Father that while we were still far off you met us in your Son and brought us home. Please help us to remember to welcome everyone, young and old, strangers and friends, as if we were welcoming you.  
- **Australia:** Guide with your wisdom and power the leaders of the nation, so that everyone may live in peace and mutual trust, sharing with justice the resources of the earth. Give the people of this land a spirit of unselfishness, compassion, and fairness in public and private life. May you bring an end to the pandemic so that we might be able to live quiet and peaceful lives in order that people may come to a knowledge of the truth. We pray that you would give our leaders wisdom and a fear of you. We pray that many in our nation who are suffering may find hope, peace, comfort, life and purpose in the gospel of your Son. May Anthony Albanese and Dominic Perrottet lead Australia and NSW well in a time of change and anxiety. 
- **Empowering Everyone with English in Jesus’ Name:** We praise you for the many people groups that are in Hurstville. May we have a heart for them to settle and live well in Australia and more importantly to find their true residence in the New Heaven. May the teachers and volunteers be a model of love and good works as they teach people about Jesus and English. 
- **CanCare:** Father God, we thank you that you know what it means to face trials and pain and that you can sympathise with our weaknesses. We ask that you’ll use CanCare to support people and their family and friends who are or have suffered the ravages of cancer. Please give them wisdom in how to support this community especially during this uncertain period of COVID. May God bless those suffering from cancer with his peace. May God's salvation come to those who have yet to accept Jesus.
- **Evangelism Teams and Programs:** Gracious Lord, our neighbours are lost and far away from you. We long for the opportunity to proclaim your name. Please give us the eyes to see those whom you have placed before us. Whenever I open my mouth, may words be given to me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel. We pray that as the seeds of the gospel are scattered and planted, that they would land on good soil. Please make them bear fruit, Father. Scare away the crows. Crush the rocks. Strangle the weeds. Instead, give us rich healthy soil ready to receive the seeds of the gospel. In Jesus’ name, we pray. 
- **Nursing Homes and Seniors Ministries:** We thank you Father, that our hope in Jesus cannot be taken from us. We remember those who are living in residential care, those who are living at home and receiving care, those who are providing the care, and their families. We pray for safety and comfort for the aged. We pray for protection for the carers, workers and volunteers from COVID and other dangers. We pray that all will hear and experience the love and peace of Christ. 
- **Cantonese Congregations:** We thank you for the leaders: d-group, ministry team, who planned and organised the ministry throughout last year. We pray that they have seen your work in church. We pray that the fruit will continue to grow. Their faithfulness of following Christ is received by God. We pray that this time of rest prepare them for your mission to carry out in 2023. We pray that people would support the church as they recognize their role in your kingdom.  Amen.
