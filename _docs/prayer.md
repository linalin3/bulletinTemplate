## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.
- **Collect:** Almighty God, grant that we, who justly deserve to be punished for our sinful deeds, may in your mercy and kindness be pardoned and restored; through our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.
- **Church Sermon:** Thank you Father that you don’t relate to us on the basis of trade. Thank you that by grace you have created the universe for our joy and delight. We are sorry that we have coveted, envied, squandered and hoarded. Sorry that we have compromised. We have been foolish to think that we can buy your forgiveness and love. We are sorry that we have neglected and ignored those who are of no value to us but of infinite value to you. Thank you that you have given Jesus to us, by grace. Thank you for your superabundant love to us. Please give us your Spirit that we may have the power to know the dimensions of your limitless love. Help us to love as you have loved us. May all power and glory, wisdom and might be to Jesus, your son, our Lord. Amen. 
- **Church mission:** _‘At that time men will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory. And he will send his angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens.’_ (Mark 13:26-27) 

Our gracious Father, thank you for the privilege of calling us to join in your mission. Thank you that under you what we do makes a difference in the world. We pray therefore that you will save those around us and to transform them into the likeness of Jesus. Please use us to make disciples of the nations, love our neighbours. Please Father, glorify yourself, through our labour in your Son. We pray that we will not be consumers but contributors to the ministries that you have called us to. 

- **Church vision - Growing Deep:** Oh Lord, how We love your law! Your word is a lamp to our feet and a light for our path. Thank you that Jesus has given us the Word of Eternal Life. Thank you that heaven and earth may pass away but our Lord’s words will never pass away. Please help us not to conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of our minds by your Word. Please help us to deepen our understanding of and obedience to your Word.

## Mission Prayer Points

- **JC in SE Asia** (with English Discipleship Groups focusing on this mission partner in March). You call us to make and mature disciples of all nations. We ask that you’ll allow JC to courageously, lovingly and prayerfully share the gospel in a country where evangelism is not allowed and even publicly practising one’s faith is difficult. May you soften the heart of the authorities and the people of this nation so that they’ll hear and accept the peace, purpose and real spiritual prosperity in Jesus. 
- **Berkeley Life Centre** (with Mandarin Discipleship Groups focusing on this mission partner in March). 
- **Compassion** (with Church including children and youth focusing on this mission partner in March).
- **Aywan and High School Scripture** (with Cantonese Discipleship Groups focusing on this mission partner in March).  
- **Mathys in PNG**

## Regular Prayer Points

- **Government:** You are the ruler of all the nations. May you prosper and direct the work of our Government so that you’ll be glorified; people will be safe; and that there’ll be prosperity, peace, happiness, truth, justice, love and compassion. May they enact laws and initiatives so that the orphans, widows and harassed are looked after. May they be good stewards as they plan in a way that looks after the earth and takes into consideration future generations. May they reward good and punish evil. As citizens, may we pay taxes to Caesar and give to God what belongs to him. As Christians, may we submit to their authority as we hold out the word of life and ultimately submit to you. 
- **Children:** Praise God for all the children at St George’s. Please grow in their hearts a love and desire for Jesus and God’s Word. Give strength to parents to disciple their children by modelling Christ-likeness in all of life. We pray for the NewGen leaders to genuinely love the kids. 
- **Youth:** Our Father, you’ve called us out of darkness into your marvellous light. May our youths and families find their strength and security in Christ and be a light in a world of darkness and at times feelings of hopelessness. May Jesus be their ultimate treasure especially in a changing and challenging world with many competing priorities and temptations. May you help them to be firm in their faith and courageous in their witness. May we be a church family who are joyful and godly witnesses as we aim to be transformed together and represent Jesus.
- **SRE:** Gracious Father, thank you for the unique and wonderful privilege to be invited to teach about Jesus in our local public school. May we never take this for granted. Give our combined Christian teacher team (Lam, Carol, George, Glorya, Tracey, Fiona, Alice and Andrew) strength to keep teaching and witnessing faithfully. 
- **Mandarin Congregation:** Pray that we may represent Jesus well in our family, in church, or in the workplace. Pray that we may not give up meeting together but encourage one another.  Pray that many members will join Discipleship groups and their lives be nurtured and shaped by God's word. Thank you Lord for bringing many newcomers to us. Pray that we will welcome newcomers with the love of Jesus and share the gospel with them. May you keep leading your people despite changes in the staff.
