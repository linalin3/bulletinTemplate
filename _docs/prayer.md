## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.

- **Collect**: Lord God, the strength of all who put their trust in you: mercifully accept our prayers, and because through the weakness of our mortal nature we can do nothing good without you, grant us the help of your grace, that in keeping your commandments we may please you both in word and deed; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

- **Growing up**: Heavenly Father, we trust your love, grace and acceptance, and that you created and saved us to live for your glory. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the saviour of the world, and your gospel as your power for salvation for all who believe. We trust in your Son Jesus Christ as the holy, loving, powerful and generous saviour, head, lord, and judge of St George’s. We trust you as the just judge of all people, and that you will bring glory to yourself through our church and in Christ Jesus. Forgive us in living for trivial happiness and false securities rather than holiness. We pray that we will die to sin every day and live for righteousness; that we will deny ourselves, take up our cross and follow Jesus every day. 


## Weekly Prayer Points
- **The Mandarin ministry and the pastor search process.**  
- **King’s Birthday**. Almighty and everlasting God, we are taught by your Word that the hearts of kings are in your rule and governance, and that you will use them according to your godly wisdom. May you use and govern the heart of Charles your Servant, our King and Governor, that, in all his thoughts, words, and works, he may ever seek your honour and glory, and preserve your people committed to his charge, in wealth, peace, and godliness.

## Mission Partners
- **Berkeley Life Centre**: Heavenly Father, you are patient, not wanting anyone to perish but all to find eternal life. You have placed people in certain places so that they may find you. We ask that you’ll sustain and use our mission partners to make and mature disciples of all nations. May we be active, involved, enthusiastic, generous and prayerful partners. We know that Jesus is gentle and lowly and invites all to cast their burdens upon him. We pray that the people in Berkeley where many are from a low socioeconomic background and some in dysfunctional relationships will cast their burdens on Jesus and find their true treasure and life in him. Please sustain Rev. Wayne Pickford and his team as they lead the church to be a light and witness in their community. May Wayne get better from his flu. May you provide the church with a suitable person to look after the children, women and Op Shop ministry.

## Regular Prayer Points
-**Australia**: Guide with your wisdom and power the leaders of the nation, so that everyone may live in peace and mutual trust, sharing with justice the resources of the earth. Give the people of this land a spirit of unselfishness, compassion and fairness in public and private life. May you bring an end to the pandemic so that we might be able to live quiet and peaceful lives in order that people may come to a knowledge of the truth. We pray that you would give our leaders wisdom and a fear of you. We pray that many in our nation who are suffering may find hope, peace, comfort, life and purpose in the gospel of your Son. May Anthony Albanese and Chris Minns lead Australia and NSW well in a time of change and anxiety. May Christians love our Indigenous population and may they come to know Christ’s love. 
-**Empowering Everyone with English in Jesus’ Name**: We praise you for the many people groups that are in Hurstville. May we have a heart for them to settle and live well in Australia and more importantly to find their true residence in the New Heaven. May the teachers and volunteers be a model of love and good works as they teach people about Jesus and English. Many many students come along to our Investigating Christianity course and find true salvation.  
-**CanCare**: Father God, we thank you that you know what it means to face trials and pain and that you can sympathise with our weaknesses. We thank you that you use CanCare to support people and their family and friends who are or have suffered from the ravages of cancer. May God bless those suffering from cancer with His peace. May God's salvation come to those who have yet to accept Jesus. If you want to know more about CanCare services, please watch the video clip from the following links: [in Cantonese with English subtitle](https://youtu.be/UFue6TYMEQA) or [in Mandarin](https://youtu.be/RrEQJKZvvs0). 
-**Evangelism Teams and Programs**: Gracious Lord, our neighbours are lost and far away from you. We long for the opportunity to proclaim your name. Please give us the eyes to see those whom you have placed before us. Whenever I open my mouth, may words be given to me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel. We pray that as the seeds of the gospel are scattered and planted, that they would land on good soil. Please make them bear fruit, Father. Scare away the crows. Crush the rocks. Strangle the weeds. Instead, give us rich healthy soil ready to receive the seeds of the gospel. May we combine our universes, listen deeply and share a story about Jesus in light of the tips we heard from our Growing Out conference. In Jesus’ name, we pray. 
-**Nursing Homes and Seniors Ministries**: We thank you Father, that our hope in Jesus cannot be taken from us. We remember those who are living in residential care, those who are living at home and receiving care, those who are providing the care, and their families. We pray for safety and comfort for the aged. We pray for protection for the carers, workers and volunteers from COVID and other dangers. We pray that all will hear and experience the love and peace of Christ. 
-**Cantonese Congregations**: Lord, we pray that after the training from Sam Chan, we will seek the ways to reach out to non-believers. Pray that in our d-group, we encourage each other to go out to our friends, family and community. Wisely engage in their activities so that relationship with non-believers can be built. We pray for the plan of training people for personal follow-up ministry. We pray that the worship team can be grown by having more pianists.  We pray for the coming three Wednesdays of Gospel class after English Class on 12:00-12:45pm. That more people are coming, our discussion is relevant to their situation and the Gospel introduce them the savior and best friend Jesus.
