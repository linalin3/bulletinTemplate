## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.
- **Collect:** Almighty Father, whose Son was revealed in majesty before he suffered death upon the cross: give us grace to perceive his glory, that we may be strengthened to suffer with him and be changed into his likeness, from glory to glory; who is alive and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. Amen.
- **Church Sermon:** Gracious Lord and heavenly father, As Bartimaeus cried out to Jesus, so we cry: ‘Son of David, have mercy on me.’ And as Jesus opened his eyes of Bartimaeus, please open our eyes that we may see Jesus clearly. Thank you that the Son of Man has come to serve and gave his life as a ransom for many. We pray that the Gospel of Jesus will turn us upside down. Please save us from our desire for power, greatness and importance. By your Spirit, please make us more and more like your Son. We pray for the many around who are still blind. Please have mercy on them and open their eyes.  Amen. 


## Weekly Prayer Points

- **For those with disabilities:** Thank you that all people are made in your image. We pray for those with disabilities that they would know their true value as your image-bearer. We pray that your love in Jesus will heal them of their experience and rejection and pain. We pray that they will know of Jesus’ sufficiency in their experience of chronic pain and suffering, that they will learn to form healthy relationships. We pray for forgiveness for the ways that we have often treated people with disabilities. Please help us to be like Jesus in welcoming those with disabilities into our church and lives. Please open our eyes to see them as whole human beings. Please help us to learn from those with disabilities as well as minister to them. We pray that by our love for one another, the world may see you. We look forward to the day when Jesus returns, when we will be given Resurrection bodies. Amen.   

- **Earthquake in Turkey and Syria**.
  - From ARDFA: Pray for God's comfort and peace on suffering Christians who are injured, traumatised or grieving and reeling from the devastation. Pray for our partners and other Christians reaching out in compassion to their communities, that God will sustain them and give them wisdom to manage their response to the crisis. Pray for God's mercy to prevent further devastation and death and for those involved in the rescue missions. Pray that churches and Christians will provide a powerful witness to God's love to suffering communities, just like they did in the 1999 Turkey earthquake.
  - From the Dean of Sydney and Anglican Aid: Almighty and gracious God, we offer our prayers to you for the nations of Türkiye and Syria, shaken by violent earthquake and aftershocks. We are reminded of our vulnerability as human creatures who inhabit this vast earth. As the ancient psalmist wrote, “You are our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in times of trouble.” Please uphold those under whom the earth has just given way. Calm their fears and enable many to turn to you for help in their distress. We pray for those in Türkiye and Syria who grieve the devastating loss of life; for the injured or traumatised; for those searching for survivors; for those whose property has been destroyed or livelihoods ruined. We ask for your healing presence in their lives. We ask you to speed access and to strengthen all those involved in search and rescue, and in care for the injured. We commend to your care those who will work in the clean up. May shelter from the elements, with clean water, food and medical care be supplied as quickly as possible. Be with the governments of these nations, and support efforts sent from other countries around the world, along with aid agencies, churches and other organisations, as they seek to serve. Sustain them through a time of tremendous stress. We pray for Turkish and Syrian migrants among us in Australia who feel homesick and far away from loved ones at this time. May generous gestures of practical aid and prayer support offered lift the spirits of those who hurt. Please help Anglican Aid’s long-term partner Damascus Church Aid as it provides food hampers to those in desperate need. We thank you for their enduring, loving witness to a people that has suffered in war and economic crisis. Please give Rev Samir Yacco and other Damascus Church Aid staff grace and wisdom to allocate resources wisely to help the most needy, bringing glory to the Lord Jesus as they share his love. We give thanks to you, our God, for the blessing in our lives, especially for the gifts we so often take for granted till they are in danger of being taken from us - the gift of family, friends, a home, our possessions. Help us to be generous with what we have for the sake of those in need. Most of all we praise you for the gift of Jesus Christ, who is the resurrection and the life to all who believe in him. And we look for the day when you will wipe every tear away from our eyes, through Jesus Christ, our rock and our redeemer. Amen.

## Mission Prayer Points

- **JC in SE Asia** (with English Discipleship Groups focusing on this mission partner in Feb): You call us to make and mature disciples of all nations. We ask that you’ll allow JC to courageously, lovingly and prayerfully share the gospel in a country where evangelism is not allowed and even publicly practicing one’s faith is difficult. May you soften the heart of the authorities and the people of this nation so that they’ll hear and accept the peace, purpose and real spiritual prosperity in Jesus. 
**Berkeley Life Centre** (with Mandarin Discipleship Groups focusing on this mission partner in Feb). 
**Compassion** (with Church including children and youth focusing on this mission partner in Feb).
**Aywan and High School Scripture** (with Cantonese Discipleship Groups focusing on this mission partner in Feb). 




## Regular Prayer Points

- **Connecting Pillar:** Please help us to be one in love so that the world will know that you sent Jesus and that you love us. Please help us to love one another with a sincere love, not just with words but by what we do. 
- **Government:** You are the ruler of all the nations. May you prosper and direct the work of our Government so that you’ll be glorified; people will be safe; and that there’ll be prosperity, peace, happiness, truth, justice, love and compassion. May they enact laws and initiatives so that the orphans, widows and harassed are looked after. May they be good stewards as they plan in a way that looks after the earth and takes into consideration future generations. May they reward good and punish evil. As citizens, may we pay taxes to Caesar and give to God what belongs to him. As Christians, may we submit to their authority as we hold out the word of life and ultimately submit to you. 
- **Children:** Praise God for all the children at St George’s. Please grow in their hearts a love and desire for Jesus and God’s Word. Give strength to parents to disciple their children by modelling Christ-likeness in all of life. We pray for the NewGen leaders to genuinely love the kids. 
- **Youth:** Our Father, you’ve called us out of darkness into your marvellous light. May our youths and families find their strength and security in Christ and be a light in a world of darkness and at times feelings of hopelessness. May Jesus be their ultimate treasure especially in a changing and challenging world with many competing priorities and temptations. May you help them to be firm in their faith and courageous in their witness. May we be a church family who are joyful and godly witnesses as we aim to be transformed together and represent Jesus.
- **SRE:** Gracious Father, thank you for the unique and wonderful privilege to be invited to teach about Jesus at our local Hurstville Public School. May we never take this for granted. The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few, therefore we pray and ask the Lord of the Harvest to please raise up more servants for this mission. Please give our combined Christian teacher team humility and renewed strength as the new school year starts. Please go ahead of the team and soften the hearts and ears of the students and staff so they may hear and receive God’s Word. 
- **Mandarin Congregation:** Pray that we may represent Jesus well in our family, in church, or in the workplace. Pray that we may not give up meeting together but encourage one another.  Pray that many members will join Discipleship groups and their lives be nurtured and shaped by God's word. Thank you Lord for bringing many newcomers to us. Pray that we will welcome newcomers with the love of Jesus and share the gospel with them.
