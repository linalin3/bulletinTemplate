## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.
- **Collect:** Almighty God, we confess that we have no power of ourselves to help ourselves: keep us outwardly in our bodies and inwardly in our souls, that we may be defended from all adversities that may happen to the body, and from all evil thoughts that may assault and hurt the soul; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
- **Church Sermon:** Gracious Lord and heavenly Father, We praise you that Jesus is your beloved Son. Forgive us that like the wicked tenants, we have rejected Jesus as our Lord and your authority over us. Sorry that we have taken what belongs to him for ourselves. Thank you for warning us of your coming judgement. We thank you that Jesus died so that we can become heirs of your Kingdom. Please help us to deny ourselves, take up our cross and follow Jesus. Please help us to make our relationship with Jesus to be the most important thing in our lives and in the life of the church. Amen.   



## Weekly Prayer Points

- **AGM**.
  - God our Father, you judge your people with wisdom and rule us with love. Give a spirit of understanding to our church. That we may make wise decisions that will give glory to you and be a blessing to your people. Grant this through our Lord Jesus Christ.
- **Pride Month**.
  - Thank you that you made us in your image. Thank you that you have given us bodies and the physical universe. Thank you that you have given us each other for relationships. Thank you that we are made to worship you and serve one another. Thank you that you know us even better than ourselves. Thank you for always having our best interest at heart. We grieve that ever since the garden of Eden, we have believed the lie that doubts your love for us, that we can determine what’s best for us without you. We grieve that as a result,  sadness, pain, confusion and death has entered into the world. Thank you that you have sent Jesus to die for us. That in Jesus, we have forgiveness, wholeness,  That you that by His Spirits we can be transformed into new people. 
  - We pray for those who are wrestling with their identity and sexuality. Forgive us when we have been slow to listen, quick to speak and quick to condemn and judge. Please help us to represent Jesus to them. Please help us to be be gentle and kind, courageous and truthful. Holding out the word of Truth and love to those like us have been blinded by the lies of the enemy and the world. Please help them to find their identity and freedom and joy and forgiveness in Jesus. 
  - Please help all of us who follow Jesus to deny ourselves, take up our cross and follow Jesus - in our thoughts, words and deed. Keep us from unfaithfulness in our thoughts, in our actions, and in what we look at. Lord again where we have failed you please forgive us. Help us to each help those who are caught up in a wrongdoing. Help us to restore each other in a gentle spirit, watching out that we won’t be tempted. Lord keep us from the sin of acting wrongly. And keep us from pride. 
  - We pray that Australia’s churches might be ‘hospitals for sinners,’ where we can safely come broken to you, where we can find people who will love us in our sin, and speak to us of the Lord Jesus, reminding us of his forgiveness, and pointing us to his Holiness. And Lord, we pray especially for those who are tempted to mock you or insult you. We ask for your mercy Lord, that you in your kindness you would extend forgiveness and love. And we pray these things in the powerful name of Jesus. Amen.

- **Persecuted Christians**: We thank you for sending Jesus who is sovereign and came to save the world by sacrificing himself. Please give patience and perseverance to those who are being persecuted for the faith. May they be an model and example of what it means to have a calling in life and a confidence for the future. May they seek to do the will of you rather than themselves. May there be justice. If this isn’t achieved, may they keep looking to you as the judge and respond with love rather than revenge.

May Compassion Australia seek to release children from poverty in Jesus’ name. May we do what we can to love children and their families so that they will mature physically, mentally, socially and most importantly spiritually. May we prayerfully invest in the lives of the children in Sumba Indonesia and see a whole region won and living for God. 
- **Redevelopment:** Our Gracious God and Heavenly Father, You know our needs. You have richly provided and we know that you will continue to provide what we need for the mission that you have called us to. May our faithful stewardship bear witness to the love of Jesus Christ in our lives. We pray this in the name of the one who is building us into a spiritual house for a holy priesthood and to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to you.
- **Sunday Services:** Thank you heavenly Father for our ascended King. Thank you for the gifts of apostles, evangelists, pastors, teachers, service leaders, musicians and all those who serve us. We pray that you will use their service for the building up of the church, that we may reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of your Son and become mature. We ask this for Bible readers, service leaders, musicians, welcomers and other volunteers. 
- **Staff and Parish Council:** We praise you for the leaders you’ve appointed over us. May they love and care for the church of God which you obtained with your own blood. May they prayerfully set forth the life giving word through their lives and teaching. Clothe them with holiness, zeal and servant heartedness. We pray for our wardens and parish councillors, may they have wisdom, insight and passion to see our church family be spiritually transformed for your glory. Please use them to help us stay focused and accountable with the resources you’ve given us. 
- **English Congregations:** Please thank God for those who’ve joined us in 2022. Please pray for those who are still online and those who may be ‘lost’. Please pray that everyone will ‘catch’ the vision of ‘representing Jesus’. Please pray for our plans to better introduce people to our church. 
- **Families:** We remember the families of our church community. We pray that despite the busyness, you will be an ever presence and comfort to them. Please help kids and their families to set the right priorities, the discipline to say ‘no’. Please be with those who feel stressed and challenged, that you will provide timely help in their needs. We thank God for all those who are part of the English congregations of this church - Wednesday, 930am and 4pm. We pray that as we seek to minister to one another in 2022, that you will mercifully cause us to grow in our knowledge of your love, that we will grow in our love for you, for one another and to our neighbours. May our love for and devotion to you be our greatest desire. We bow our knees before you the Father from whom every family is named. Bless our homes. Help parents and spiritual uncles and aunties to impart the knowledge of you and of your love; and children to respond with love and obedience. May our homes be blessed with peace, truth and joy. We praise you, God of love and the creator of the universe, for making us male and female, and giving us the gift of each other. We pray for those who, like our Lord Jesus Christ, are unmarried; either by external factors, their own decision and/or devotion to you. Lord, we praise you for the new family you have created, the household of all who believe in your Son. Father, help us to love one another in deep and meaningful friendships that no one may feel alone or without the joy of companionship. Deepen our trust in your provision for all our needs so that we may live in contentment until we all come to your eternal kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
