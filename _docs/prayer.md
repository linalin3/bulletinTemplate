## Sunday Prayer Points

- **Lord’s Prayer:** Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.
- **Collect:** Lord of all power and might, the author and giver of all good things, graft in our hearts the love of your Name, increase in us true religion, nourish us with all goodness, and so by your mercy keep us; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen
- **Growing Out:** Our gracious Father, thank you that the Gospel is the power of salvation to all people. We pray that many in our generation will hear and truly understand your grace. Please help us to take our faith in Jesus beyond the walls of the church into our workplace, school, where we live and where we holiday. Please help us to have compassion for the lost like Jesus. Please help us to be willing to go into the world, to be interested in the lives of people we meet. Please give us opportunities to represent Jesus and to speak of Him. Please give us the words to say. Please save our neighbours through us.
- **Church Sermon:** Gracious Lord and Heavenly Father, We thank you for our church, for every member of our church family (even those who may have hurt us, those who have ignored us or excluded us, those who have not met our expectations). We thank you because of your grace given to them in Christ Jesus. Thank you that you enriched them and us in every way—in all our speaking and in all our knowledge. Thank you that we do not lack any spiritual gift as we eagerly wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed. Forgive us for being prideful and self righteous. Save us from cynicism, indifference and impatience. Please help me to see myself as loved by you. Please keep us strong to the end, so that we will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

## Mission Partners
- **Local High School Scripture with Aywan:** Loving Father, we thank you that you want all people to come to a saving knowledge of you. We ask that the high schoolers in our area (especially at Hurstville Boys, Sydney Tech and Oatley High) will see Jesus as the way, the truth and the life. May you help students to find their identity and security in Jesus particularly when things get busy, life doesn’t work out as planned and things may seem confusing and meaningless. We pray that Aywan Suleiman will passionately and faithfully teach and model the gospel of love to the students and the people around him. We praise you for allowing a group at Oatley to start up. We ask that you’ll grow the number of students who get to hear about Jesus including the Year 7 group at Hurstville Boys. May all find their wisdom in Jesus. 
- **Papua New Guinea and Mathys:** Father God, we realise that all flesh is like grass yet your word remains forever. We ask that you will use the Mathys and other bible translators to transform PNG for Jesus with your precious and powerful word. We pray that Petra, Andi and Jakob will keep growing in Christ and being missional. May the 17 million people in PNG come to know Christ as their Lord and Saviour. Please help the locals to cope with the rising cost of living and uncertainties about the future. 
- **JC in SE Asia:** You call us to make and mature disciples of all nations. We ask that you’ll allow JC to courageously, lovingly and prayerfully share the gospel in a country where evangelism is not allowed and even publicly practising one’s faith is difficult. May you soften the heart of the authorities and the people of this nation so that they’ll hear and accept the peace, purpose and real spiritual prosperity in Jesus. In light of the authorities inspecting churches and people’s houses, we ask that believers may be safe, have wisdom, keep trusting in Jesus, love others and glorify God.

## Regular Prayer Points
- **Hurstville**: We pray for the growing number of people in Hurstville, with many from different cultures and countries, will come to know Jesus as their Lord and Saviour. May we have a heart for the people you have placed around us. May we be lights in our neighbourhood which is in darkness and filled with anxiety and uncertainty. May we be mindful of the changing demographics and seek to share the gospel with them. May go out to where they lost are to save them with the gospel of Christ. May Chris Minns (NSW Premier and Legislative Assembly Member for Kogarah), Linda Burney (House Representative for Barton), David Coleman (House Representative for Banks) and Nick Katris (Mayor) know God as the one with the ultimate authority and serve with love, justice and wisdom.
- **Discipleship Groups**: We ask that the seed of God’s word will be planted and watered this term and that God will give the growth. May we have clear direction, wisdom and discipline as we rebuild our discipleship ministry and represent Jesus. May we grow up and have Jesus as the most important thing in our lives, grow deep as we know and obey the Bible and grow out as we represent Him.
- **Pastoral Care Team:** Father, you sent your Son to heal the brokenhearted. May we cast our burdens and anxieties upon you knowing that you can sympathise with our weaknesses and care for us. May the peace of God sustain us as we bear the hope of the gospel, point people to heaven and carry each other’s burdens.
- **People with Disabilities:** Thank you that all people are made in your image. We pray for those with disabilities that they would know their true value as your image-bearer. We pray that your love in Jesus will heal them of their experience and rejection and pain. We pray that they will know of Jesus’ sufficiency in their experience of chronic pain and suffering, that they will learn to form healthy relationships. We pray for forgiveness for the ways that we have often treated people with disabilities. Please help us to be like Jesus in welcoming those with disabilities into our church and lives. Please open our eyes to see them as whole human beings. Please help us to learn from those with disabilities as well as minister to them. We pray that by our love for one another, the world may see you. We look forward to the day when Jesus returns, when we will be given Resurrection bodies. Amen.
- **Support Ministries:** Everlasting God, we give thanks for the many volunteers who have been faithfully serving in different ministries at church especially in this challenging period of time. Please strengthen and sustain them with patience and understanding that they may love and care for your people. Please grant that together they may follow and help others to follow Jesus Christ. May they offer their given gifts and talents to build up the church which is the body of Christ. We ask this for the communication, vestry, cleaning, flower, bulletin, meals, AV, sound, technology and other teams. May people come under the wings of your love and salvation. 
- **New Life Nepalese Church:** We thank you for our Nepalese brothers and sisters who share our building. May they grow in their knowledge of your love for them and continue to speak the truth in love to their community. We pray that through their ministry, many more Nepalese would come to serve the Lord Jesus Christ, as we do. 
- **Singles, Widows and Orphans:** We praise you, God of love and the creator of the universe, for making us male and female, and giving us the gift of each other. We pray for those who, like our Lord Jesus Christ, are unmarried; either by external factors, their own decision and/or devotion to you. Lord, we praise you for the new family you have created, the household of all who believe in your Son. Father, help us to love one another in deep and meaningful friendships that no one may feel alone or without the joy of companionship. Deepen our trust in your provision for all our needs so that we may live in contentment until we all come to your eternal kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
