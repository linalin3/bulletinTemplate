### Big Idea: 
God chooses by grace not by height. 

### Questions:
1. What is the ‘halo effect’? What might be some examples you’ve seen or when you have been impacted by this effect? 
2. Please read 1 Samuel 16:1-13. 
  - What happened in the passage?
  - What do you notice from the passage? 
  - An important verse is v.7. What do you think the phrase ‘The Lord does not look at the things man looks at. Man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart’ means? Does it mean God looks at: 
    - Motives and thoughts;  
    - Real spiritual (‘obedience’) rather than pretend spirituality )‘sacrifice’) ;
    - Faith (e.g. David wasn’t a perfect guy, but he trusted God the way that Saul didn’t); 
    - Other? 
  - Does it mean that God chose David because he’s a better man than Saul? 
  - If God didn’t choose David on the basis of his appearance, the purity of his motives and thoughts, his faithfulness in obedience or faith, then what is the basis of God’s choice of David? (c.f. 1 Corinthians 1:26-31)
3. How does the idea of grace help your plans to grow up in Jesus and grow out with Jesus?
