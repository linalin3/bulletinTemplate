### Big Idea 
Idolatry is folly and superstition, turn your trust to the Lord in Jesus and obey him.   



### Questions

- Can you give examples/incidents of how God has lost? How have they affected you and others? 
- What is the Ark of the covenant of God and why was it important to the Isrealites? (Exodus 25:1-22; Joshua 3 and 6)
- Please read 1 Samuel 4:2-22 What happened? 
  - What do you think of the elders’ response to the defeat to the skirmish (v.3)? 
  - What are the different reactions to the Ark and what happened to it in this account? And what do these reactions tell you about the underlying thinking? Is the thinking right?
    - The Israelites 
    - The Philistines 
    - Eli and Phinehas’ widow 
    - You as the reader 

Please read 1 Samuel 5. What happened? What happened to: 
- The Ark
- Dagon
- The Philistines 

Brian suggests that the opposite of faith is superstition. Do you agree? Why/why not? 

Is God for us or against us? (c.f. Joshua 5:13–15) What does ‘neither’ for you mean? 

What have you learned about: 
God
How He works (and God loosing) 
Idolatry 
How people relate to God
