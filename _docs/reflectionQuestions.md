### Big Idea
Grace is accepted resulting in obedience

### Questions
1. Why would any idol of our God be inadequate?
2. Is a picture of Christ an idol?
3. God first saves the O. T. Hebrews and then gives them the law to show how to relate to him so how is this similar to us as N.T. believers?
4. What benefits do you see in observing Sunday as the “Lord’s Day” rather than just a  “day off”?
5. Reading Numbers 15:30-31 does this challenge your ideas of how God sees being disrespected and the “soft, fluffy” view of God that some Christians have?
