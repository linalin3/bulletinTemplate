### Big Idea 
The book of Samuel is part of Jesus’ back story. Knowing this story will help us to know Jesus deeper.  1 Samuel 1 reminds us that God is no one’s debtor. He is not on our side against our enemies. He is His own side. We are invited to join Him. 


### Questions
1. Bartimaeus identified Jesus as the ‘Son of David’ (Mark 10:47-48). Why do you think that this is relevant to what Bartimaeus was hoping for? Does the idea that Jesus is the Son of David inspires us with the same hope and confidence? 

    [1 and 2 Samuel was one book - “Samuel”, and was eventually divided into 2 scrolls. It wasn’t called Samuel, but ‘Reigns’ or ‘Kings’. 

    The book is set in the time of the Judges and is full of the type of twists and turns that we would find in a great Hollywood blockbuster- political intrigue, family turmoil, sex, betrayal etc. The book is about the monarchy. But this too is not the main theme. The key question of the book is: how will God keep His promise to save His people and bless the nations, and reverse the Curse of the Fall. God’s plan has to do with David and the promise about his Son. God will bring His kingdom on earth through the means of a covenant. As the story of Samuel unfolds, we get deeper insight into who our God is, how He works, and who we are.

    If you have done so, please consider reading through 1 and 2 Samuel.] 
    
    Please read Judges 21:25 : 

2. What is the context of the book of Samuel? 
   
   Please read 1 Samuel 1 and 2: 

3. What happened? Who are the characters, what are they like, what happened, what stood out to you? (How is this story similar to other stories in the Bible so far?) 

4. Why was Hannah so distressed? 

    Hannah reflects Israel at the time. How? 

5. Where is the LORD in the story so far? 

6. Is Hanah’s prayer (v.11) a bargain with the LORD? Why and why not? If it’s not a bargain then what is it? 

    Her prayer in 1 Samuel 2:1-11 shows us to understand Hannah’s understanding of the LORD. What does this prayer tell you about the LORD? 


    How might this understanding of the LORD challenge you? 

    What does this understanding of God tell you about how God might save His people?  

    How might this understanding of the LORD help you to understand Jesus more deeply?
