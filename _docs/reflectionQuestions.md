### Big Idea 
Discipleship is following the narrow road of giving. Christians give because our God is a giving God. The narrow road of discipleship is a life of grace and faith 

### Questions 
1. ‘Jesus is the Christ. So what?’ How would you answer this question?  

2. Mark 8 is a turning point in the Gospel of Mark. Jesus has been speaking in parables, now he is speaking plainly. What is the direct and clear teaching about who he is? 

3. Peter’s response to Jesus’ teaching reflects human thinking. This is different to who Jesus is. How? 

4. What does following Jesus involve? What does it mean to ‘deny’ ourselves? What is the result of doing/not doing this? What may be holding us back from denying ourselves and following Jesus? What might denying yourself to follow Jesus mean? 

5. The incident in Mark 8:14-32 shows that the disciples are still thinking the thoughts of man and not of God. How? How might we do this?
