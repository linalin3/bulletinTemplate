### Big Idea:
We can confront the most brutal reality about church and ourselves because of the unwavering confidence we have in what God has done and is doing through Jesus in us. 


### Questions:
1. How do you choose a church (what happened? what criteria do you use?)

2. Please read through Acts 18 and the whole of 1 Corinthians (at home). Paul wrote several letters to the church at Corinth. We know there were at least 4 and only 2 have been included into the Canon. Write down everything you can remember about the church at Corinth:
  - Would you choose to be part of the Corinthian church? Why and why not? 

3. How does Paul ‘see’ the Corinthian Church (v.2)? How does he describe them (what do these terms mean)? 

 - Why does Paul see the church this way (vv.4-9)?  

 - What does he do as a result of seeing the church this way? 

 - Do you ‘always thank God’ for your church? What do you thank God for? What might make you unthankful for the church? 


Because of Paul’s unwavering confidence in what God has done and is doing at Corinth, what does he do (vv.10-17)? 

What is apparently the problem at Corinth? Does Paul just want Christians to avoid disagreement? What does he want Christian to do? 

What does it mean to see church, yourself and others and your relationship with them ‘cross-eyed’? 

What are some of the brutal realities of church? How does the Gospel help you to address them?  

How might the Gospel help you to be an active part of the church family?
