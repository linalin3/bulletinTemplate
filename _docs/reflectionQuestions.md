### Big Idea 
Seeing Jesus clearly will transform us into like Him, a slave of all.  


### Questions 
1. How has Jesus radically changed you? 
2. Jesus explains what will happen to him the third time in Mark 10:32-34. He further explains the meaning of the suffering in v.45. What is it? And how does this challenge our thinking about being rescued? 
3. Please read Mark 10:35-45. The disciples still do not understand the Cross. How do we know that? What is it that they don’t understand? 
    - How does Jesus correct their understanding? 
    - What would happen if James and John got what they wanted? V.42
    - In what ways do we grasp for power and control? Why do we grasp? 
    - What is Jesus’ alternative to grasping for power and control? 
    - Does this mean that Christians are doormats? If not, why not? What are Christians then? 
4. Please Mark 10:46-52. How is Bartimaeus different to (almost the opposite of) the disciples? How is Bartimaeus a model of discipleship and faith? 
5. “What do you want me to do for you?” Rewrite the following prayers into Cross-shaped prayers 

| **What do you want me to do for you? | How can you think of a Cross Shaped Prayer** |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Please help me/my child pass this exam.  |   |

6. What is the right/wrong motivation to serve? What does being a servant like Jesus mean to you? How have you done this?
