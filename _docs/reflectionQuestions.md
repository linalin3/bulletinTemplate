### Big Idea 
Jesus alone is able to do what we cannot do. As a result, salvation is through Jesus alone. 

### Questions
1. If you’re comfortable, share a time when you feel ‘sick to your stomach’. What happened? How did you feel? 
2. Mark 14:27-52 is another one of Mark’s sandwich. A story with 3 scenes. The two scenes on the outside (vv.27-31; vv.43-52) to highlight and contrast the scene in the middle (vv.32-42).  
    - Vv.1-2; Vv.10-11; Vv.3-9
    - What does Jesus pray for? Why does he pray for this? 
    - If Jesus is God, if he’s in control (as the narrative shows), and if he knows that he will rise from the dead on the third day, why is he distressed and troubled, overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death? 
    - Is Jesus trying to get God the Father to change His mind? If not, what is He praying for?  
    - It’s not uncommon to think that this is another moment that Jesus is responding to his circumstances as a man (he puts aside his nature as God at this point). What is the problem with this? And what does this scene tell us about God (the Father and the Son)? 

3. Hope does this passage help us to grow up in our relationship with Jesus? 
     - How would our love be different if we love like God? Who would we love? 

4. How does Mark 14 help me in growing up in my relationship with Jesus, and growing out with my faith in Jesus?
- How does it help us to grow out with our faith in Jesus?
