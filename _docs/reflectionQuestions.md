2.     Why did the high priest, chief priests, elders and teachers of the law want Jesus dead? 
3.     How can people be like the high priest etc. in their attitudes and actions to Jesus?

6.     Why did Peter deny Jesus? 
7.     How can people be like Peter in their attitudes and actions to Jesus? 
7.     Who are you like? When and how have you failed Jesus? 
8.     How do we see God being in control and fulfill his plans to forgive sinners? 
9.     Why does Jesus publicly tell people who he is only now and not before? 
10.    Where are the ironies in these events? What does it show? 
11.     How is God’s judgment of humanity being placed on Jesus? 
13.     What would it look like for you to mourn over your sins? 
14.     What would it look like to have confidence in God and in his power and plans?
15.     If you aren’t confident, how can you grow in your confidence of God and subsequently yourself? If you are confident, how can you grow in your confidence of God and not yourself?
