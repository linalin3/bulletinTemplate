### Big Idea 
Sin is taking what rightly belongs to Jesus for ourselves. Sin stops us to following Jesus.


### Questions

1. What difference would it make to St George’s if most members of the church can say: ‘my relationship with Jesus is the most important thing to me, it controls everything that I do’? What do you think is stopping us from being fully surrendered disciples of Jesus? 


2. ‘The greatest hostility to Jesus is religion.’ What is the evidence of this in Mark’s Gospel so far? 

    How has Israel trusted in their religion rather than the Lord? 

    How might we be trusting religion rather than Jesus? 

Please read Mark 11:27-33

3. The religious people challenged Jesus’ authority. How does Jesus answer them? How has Jesus answered their question (c.f. Mark 1:9-11)? 

4. Please read Mark 12:1-12
    Jesus tells a parable. What is the parable about? 

    How does the parable relate to the conflict between Jesus and religion? 

    What does the parable tell us about the motive for choosing religion over Jesus, or choosing to not deny ourselves to follow Jesus? 

    Please reflect and share: ‘To refuse to fully deny ourselves and surrender to Jesus is to rob Jesus of his glory and authority.’  

5. What is the result of tenants killing the heir? How is this God’s greatest victory and hope for sinners? V.9-11

6. What does this passage tell us about:
    - Growing up in our relationship with Jesus? 
    - Growing deep in our understanding of the Bible? 
    - Growing out with our faith in Jesus outside the church?
