### Big Idea 
Rid ourselves of our idol and turn to our saviour wholeheartedly and worship Him alone by active trust and obedience to Jesus.  


### Questions

1. ‘Because God is for us, we will be safe.’ Discuss. Please read 1 Samuel 7:2-17
2. What happened? 
 - Why were the Israelites crying out to the Lord? 
 - What did Samuel tell them to do? What does it mean to get rid of idols and serve the Lord alone? 
 - What happened when the Philistines attacked the Israelites at Mizpah? 
 - What have you noticed about how the Lord saved them? Please read 1 Samuel 8
3. What happened?
 - What do you observe about the elder’s request in v.5? What makes it both reasonable and irrational? 
 - The Lord saw it as sin/rebellion/rejection of Him as king vv.7-8. How was this request a rejection of Lord as king? 
 - Put the warning to Israel in your own word please  vv.10-18. 
 - What happened at the end?
