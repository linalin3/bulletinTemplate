### Big Idea
Final rest is actually being with God.

### Questions

1. Read Revelation 21:1-5 and explain what stands out to you as blessing.
2. Why do you think we often (sometimes) find personal Bible study challenging to be consistent with? What is the answer to this?
3. Psalm 23 speaks about resting securely in the care of the Lord. What verse do you think is the climax of the Psalm and why?
4. Revelation 14:13 speaks of “ rest from their labours” so what do you think are some of these “labours”?
5. If being with Jesus is the best thing about Heaven, why might non believers be interested in going there?
