### Big Idea 
Contempt to God is not giving what is due to Him. Contempt to the Lord by those whom he has given the privileged to represent him results in ignorance of God and blasphemy towards Him. But God will raise up for himself a faithful priest and representative. 


### Questions
1. What are some (public or private) examples of Christian leaders failing? What happened? What has been the impact (on you and the society) of such failures? 


2. What is the priesthood and the tabernacle? Why are they important to Israel and to the world? (Gen 12:2-3; Exodus 19:5-6; Deut 4:6; Ex 15:17; 36:8-39:43) 

   
   Please read 1 Samuel 2:11-36. 

3.  What did Hophni and Phineas do? What is wrong with what they did? 

    What is contempt towards the Lord? 

    What did Eli do and failed to do? 

    How did he ‘honour’ his sons more than the Lord? 


4.  How will the Lord redeem this situation? 

    Why is it important that Luke applies 1 Samuel 2:26 to Jesus (Luke 2:52)? 

    Why is it good news to us that Jesus is our high priest (Hebrews 8)? 


5.  Who are the priests of the Lord in the New Testament (1 Peter 2:9-12).  

    How might we show contempt towards God? 

    How might we be honouring people or things more than the Lord? 

    What do you think the Lord will do? 

    What can we do to be faithful priests?
