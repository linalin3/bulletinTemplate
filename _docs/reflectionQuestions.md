### Big Idea: Every Christian is a missionary from Jesus into the World so that everyone will have the love of God. 


### Questions:
1. What is your mission in life? 
2. What is Jesus’ mission for you? Where is Jesus sending you? What is he sending you to do? And how will you do this (think of all the contexts that you’re in)?
